Charms are the natural expression of a character’s essence, a specific
and trained way for their internal power to be expressed upon the world.

Typically, a character does not know they are using a specific charm: it
is simply an instinctual channeling of essence to produce the desired
effect.

Charms available to all Exalts, such as the Ability Charms will manifest
uniquely based on their exaltation. A Lunar might borrow the eyes of a
falcon to see further, while an Air Dragonblood would create a focal
lens out of the air—but they both would spend the same number of motes
and end up with the same perception advantage. The Player should be
encouraged to take their own unique spin on the Charm.

Don’t be afraid to take your own unique spin on describing a charm’s
powers!

System Presentation
-------------------

Charms, and other powers, will have a header designating quick
information.

> **Type:** Reflexive; Scene  
> **Cost:** 1m

### Type

The **Type** will designate the rules for how it can be activated, and
how long the power will last, as follows:

> **Type:** (Activation); (Duration)

**Activation Types:**

-   **Simple.** Consumes an entire Action.

-   **Supplemental.** Does not consume an action, but can only be
    activated on a character’s turn. Often, the text of the charm will
    describe some additional restriction—for example supplementing a
    Strike action.

-   **Reflexive.** Does not consume an action, and can be used outside
    of the normal turn order. Often will have specific conditions that
    need to be met to be used, such as “in response to being attacked.”

-   **Permanent.** Once purchased, this power is always active.

-   **Ritual.** Requires a specific set of conditions to be performed,
    and will often take longer than a single action to activate.

The duration then specifies how long the power will naturally be active
for. This ranges from the remainder of the **Scene**, to days, to even
stranger conditions. If a duration is not specified, the duration is
**Instant**, meaning that it immediately activates and then dissipates.

Exalts may always prematurely terminate their Powers early, if so
desired.

<td><p>Resolving Timing Conflicts</p>
<p>If there is ever a timing conflict, such as with two Reflexive Charms going off at once, the resolution goes according to the defender’s choice.</p>
<p>If that is still unclear, there should be a contested roll using the relevant Finesse Attribute: Dexterity, Insight, or Wits.</p></td>
</tr>

### Cost

The cost of charms is almost always designated in terms of **Motes (m)**
or **Anima** **(a)**. The character must remove the designated number of
motes or anima from their sheet to activate the power. The motes or
anima then must be regained through their natural means.

### Prerequisite

Occasionally, a charm will require a prerequisite before being
purchased, such as a different charm, or dots of a particular ability.

The Minor Charm
---------------

The Powers of the Exalted are not restricted to life-changing,
magnificent events. Sometimes they just desire to Show Off.

Spend 1 mote and perform an action that is has a most a minor utility
effect which appropriately themed to your character. Much like a Stunt:
so long as it is cool and appropriate, it is allowed.

For example, you may use a burning Anima as a light source, shoot sparks
into the air to the delight of onlookers, or purify your clothes of
accumulated grime. A Fire Dragonblooded could light all candles in a
room, punctuating a dramatic entrance.

Greater and Capstone
--------------------

Some Powers are designated as **Greater** or **Capstone** Powers. These
powers require extra skill and precision to use, and so cannot be
learned until **Essence 3** or **5**, respectively. Normal charms are
sometimes called **Lesser** Charms, to help differentiate between the
tiers.

There are very few Greater or Capstone Universal Charms—these almost
always the domain of Exaltation specific areas.

### <span class="smallcaps">Upgrade</span>

Most charms can only be purchased once, and at a set power level.
However, there are some Charms and Powers that may have their power
increased through an upgrade—increasing a Lesser Charm to a Greater
Charm, and so on. Only the XP difference must be paid, and the Exalt
retains all lesser benefits when they do so.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Unstoppable Force, Immovable Object</p>
<p>As the player enters into the <em>Capstone</em> level of play, they will start to gain some extremely powerful Charms that simply declare that <em>something happens</em>. This can run aground of other effects of equal power that may something <em>different happens.</em> The classic situation is a Power declares that it <em>hits</em> another, while another Power declares that they <em>are not hit</em>.</p>
<p>Whenever a situation like this occurs, the two side should immediately perform a relevant <em>Contested Roll</em> (e.g. Accuracy vs. Defense) to see which Power overwhelms the other.</p>
<p>As consolation, the losing side regains half of the motes/anima spent to activate it (rounded up), and does not “use up” the Power if it is limited use—such as once per Scene.</p></td>

Custom Charms
-------------

Making and using Custom charms (or other powers) is completely
encouraged. Creating a charm follows much the same rule as a
[Strife](/System/The System/#strife): “Is this cool?” and “Does it enhance the story to
have?”

### Judging Level

-   **Lesser** means this will be a standard power for an
    Exalt—something they would have with little training or experience.
    Remember that Exalted is a high-powered system: simple tricks are
    something you can do with a roll, and don’t require a dedicated
    charm!

    These typically cost 1-2 motes to activate.

-   **Greater** powers will be those that fundamentally *changes* how
    your character plays and interacts with the world, and are only
    available after concentrated study and enlightenment. Greater Powers
    represent someone who is a *master* at what they do.

    These typically cost 2-3 motes, or 1-3 anima.

-   **Capstone** powers are those whose presence and use will utterly
    warp the narrative around them, reserved for only the highest and
    most powerful of Exalts. Capstone Powers are reserved for Exalts of
    *Legend*, which is why Solars with their Supernal Force are so
    terrifying.

    These typically cost 3-6 anima.

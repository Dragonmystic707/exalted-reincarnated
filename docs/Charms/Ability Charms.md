<p><strong>Fists of the Street Form</strong><br />
Your unarmed strikes become as strong as either Light or Medium weapons, while retaining the Natural tag. This style cannot be used with armor.</p>

**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Cost:** 2m

**Type:** Supplemental; Scene  
**Cost:** 1m

The Exalt may conjure scenery, props, or other phantoms as extensions of
their anima, showing up as distorted, shadowy figures. In typical
application, such as on stage or during a structured performance, this
illusion does not arouse suspicion of the Exalt’s nature—people will be

disguise this as a mundane effect.

### Shining Expression Style

**Type:** Simple

spilling a drink, readjusting their observing position, or simply
clearing their mind.

### Discretionary Gesture

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 1m

A chain is only as strong as its weakest link—a fact known by any in the
socialite circles. Through subtle (and not-so subtle) means, the Exalt

own Resolve in place of their Ally’s.

### Easily-Discarded Presence

**Type:** Reflexive; Scene  
**Cost:** 2m

### Irresistible Salesman Spirit

**Type:** Simple; Day  
**Cost:** 2m

fascination, idea, or desire for a product in the target—so long as it
does not conflict with an existing Intimacy.

and will attempt to pursue it, potentially leaving their posts or other
aspects of their life temporarily behind.

as needed for a week, gaining (3) additional dice to do so.

### Hidden Meaning

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 2m

The Exalt hides their true meaning in inflections, allusions, and other
roundabout ways of speaking, writing, or other methods of communication.

notice that there is a coded message.

### False Pursuit

**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Cost:** 2m

target, they become convinced that an ultimately benign or small point

composition, which is a keystone to their case, despite the blades being
only slightly out of normal make.

### Flashing Quill Atemi

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** 1m

With just a short moment in possession of a written text, the Exalt may
insert, expunge, or replace words as they see fit. No mundane means or
mortal characters will be able decipher the difference between the
altered content.

An Exalt, God, or other creature of power must successfully contest the
Guile of the forging Exalt to notice that the document has been altered
at all—let alone what specifically has been altered.

### Mind-Wiping Gaze

**Type:** Reflexive; Scene  
**Cost:** 3m

The Exalt pierces the target with a gaze that penetrates the very soul,
extinguishing the flame of memories.

Interrupt a target taking a Social Influence action, or who is
attempting to communicate in a way. On a successful Subterfuge vs.
Resolve roll, the target loses their thoughts and memories regarding
their action and immediately fails on their action. In addition, they
cannot remember to pick the task up again until after the scene. This
may only be done once per scene.

that are not part of Creation—such as Demons, Fae, and those whom have
purposefully cut themselves off, gain +2 against this sense.

### Sense-Destroying Method

**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Cost:** 2m

On touching a target with a successful (Awareness) vs Defense roll, the
Exalt can impede one of the classical five senses at their choice for a
scene. Only one sense of a target may be clouded per scene.

This effect is considered a Moderate Disadvantage, and can be cleared
with a dedicated roll that exceeds the Awareness value of the Exalted.

### Surprise Anticipation Method

**Type:** Permanent

The Exalt suffers no penalties to Awareness rolls occur due to being
tired, exhausted, or other similar mental disadvantage. Awareness rolls
may always be made while asleep.

### Uncanny Perception Technique

**Type:** Permanent

The presence of dematerialized, intangible, or otherwise spectral
creatures may be natively detected—although the precise location still
remains a mystery. The creature may attempt a contested (Awareness) vs.
(Stealth) roll combat this.

This sense will manifest in all manner of strange sensory phenomena
appropriate to the being: a chill of winter, coppery taste, or the sound
of bells. As well, this sense is distinctive to the specific being,
allowing for recognition upon sensing it again.

 Craft
-----

### Workshop Without Bounds

**Type:** Permanent

In the hands of the Exalt, a simple rock can become as strong and
resilient as a blacksmith’s hammer, and a grand sword as nimble as a

delicate changes to the flow of essence lines in an Artifact.

**Cost:** 2m

The Exalt studies an object, forming its composition and structure into
their mind.

Craft) with a +2 dice advantage to study other objects to recognize it
as the crafter’s work, and not a forgery.

If this current object they are studying is in fact a forgery,

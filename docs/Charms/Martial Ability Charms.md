Archery
-------

### Arrow Storm Technique

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** 2m

The sky becomes filled with a barrage of arrows, blotting out the
celestial bodies with their mass before they come crashing down into
their foes.

Attack up to (Archery) foes in a single, *adjacent* Zone with a single
dice roll. You deal -2 less damage on this flurried attack.

### Cruel Thorns

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 2m

If you roll 8 or more successes on an Archery Strike (and hit the
target), you may add an additional (Attribute + Essence)/2 damage to
your attack.

### Dragonfly Finds Mate

**Type:** Permanent

The arrow flies true and with purpose, deflecting any incoming
projectiles before they have a chance to hit their intended target.

Against any ranged attack, you may gain a Third Defense of (Dexterity +
Archery)/2 + (Weapon Acc.). This may be used to Defend Others at a Range
equal to that of your weapon’s.

### Splitting the Arrow

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 1m

The Exalt strikes with unerring accuracy and lethality, finding the
smallest chink of armor and exploiting it.

Your attack now targets Evasion only: dealing full damage if successful,
and no damage otherwise.

### Wise Arrow

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 1m (+2)

With perfect control, the Exalt lets loose a bolt of a perfect arc to
strike their target.

The Exalt may target creatures through the smallest of cracks, over
impossibly high barriers, or even through slits between a door. So long
as a single, uninterrupted arch exists to the target, they are a valid
enemy, and derive no benefit from cover.

For an additional +2motes, this may increase an Archery attack by one
Zone.

### Flashing Anticipation

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 1m

action instead of 2.

**Cost:** 1m

The Exalt may double their running speed for a specific task, blazing

(Essence) successes to their roll.

In combat, this allows a person to cross an additional Zone on a move
action.

### Reed in the Wind

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** (1m per 1 Dmg.)

maximum of 5.

### Soaring Leap

**Type:** Reflexive; Scene  
**Cost:** 1m

The Exalt increases their leaping distance, allowing them to cross
chasms and scale buildings. They may effortlessly leap a single story
vertically or horizontally in one bound, and may continue to vault
upwards if there is some surface firm enough for their force.

descending from all but the tallest of buildings.

and larger than your arm. This is classified as a medium brawl weapon

### Knockout Kick

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 1m

lower than yours when succeeding on a Brawl vs. Block roll.

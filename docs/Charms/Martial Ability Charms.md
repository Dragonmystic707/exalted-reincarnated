<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Fists of the Street Style</p>
<p>Brawl interfaces heavily with Martial Arts Styles, which hone a stylists body into weapons rivaling and surpassing forged steel. However, not every character has access to, nor sometimes the inclination, to becoming a master Martial Artist.</p>
<p>Instead, they will form their own, untrained style that is often called “Fists of the Street” Style.</p>
<p>While this style has no proper techniques, nor unified history behind it, it is as deadly and useful as any “true” Martial Arts.</p>
<p><strong>Fists of the Street Form</strong><br />
Your unarmed strikes become as strong as either Light or Medium weapons, while retaining the Natural tag. This style cannot be used with armor.</p>
<p>In this style, you gain +1 Evasion, up to an unarmored maximum of 6.</p></td>

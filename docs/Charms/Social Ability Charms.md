Command
-------

### Command-Breaking Stance

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** 1m

A skilled commander knows what brings drilled groups together, and what
can break them apart.

The Exalt breaks up a group of Lesser Foes, causing their next actions
to be lost as they reform.

### Direct Orders

**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Cost:** 2m

The Exalt may take charge of a group of allied Lesser Foes, directing
their action, and granting them a moderate advantage on that action for
the remainder of the scene. This boon cannot be stacked.

### Fury Inciting Speech

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** 1m

The Exalt immediately Instills anger, rage, or a similar emotion into
any mortal or sapient creature that can observe the Exalt with an
Essence Rating less than their own.

### Organization of Command

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 1m

The Exalt may command across large groups with great ease. When
commanding a Group to Perform a Task, the Exalt may negate any Resolve
bonus from being in a Group.

### Ritual of Endowment

**Type:** Permanent

You may now perform Projects to grant the Rank 3 [Endowment](/System/The Exalted/#endowment)
Merit to those with significant ties to the character, granting them
limited access to a single Supernatural Ability.

***Note:** This charm does nothing for Exalts that have no supernatural
abilities, such as Solars.*

### Rulership-<span class="smallcaps">Identifying Glance</span>

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 1m

With but a glance, the leader of a group can be immediately recognized
if present, even if that leader is acting through a proxy. If they are
not present, the Exalt recognizes this fact.

This charm immediately succeeds against any mundane group interaction,
but against an unnatural foe requires a contested Command vs. Subterfuge
roll.

 Investigation
-------------

### <span class="smallcaps">Attentive Listener’s Ear</span>

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** 1m

The Exalt brings a friendly and relaxing air with them, pushing others
to more easily speak their mind—and spill their secrets.

On any attempt to prod someone for information, sift through a rambling
story, or otherwise parse a spoken testimony, gain +3 dice.

### <span class="smallcaps">Crafty Observation Method</span>

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** 2m

Examining undisturbed physical evidence, the Exalt is able to
reconstruct what happened to bring that object to its present condition.

You may immediately, and without a roll, Recall a Fact about the Scene,
focused on a particular object. This may only be used once per Scene.

### <span class="smallcaps">Irresistible Questioning Technique</span>

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** 2m

Through either compassion or terror, the Exalt is able to force words
out of even the most stubborn of witnesses.

As a question and immediately roll Investigation vs. Resolve. If
successful, the target will reveal one useful fact related to a
question—either by spilling it directly through words, or indirectly
through something such as a subtle glance. If the target has no useful
information to give, that fact is relayed instead.

### <span class="smallcaps">Motive-Discerning Perception</span>

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** 1m

Immediately make a Read Intentions roll against a target, without need
for them to take an action.

### Watchful Justiciar’s Eye

**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Cost:** 2m

By observing for an action, the Exalt can identify which characters of
the scene are behaving outside what would be considered normal for the
scene. They may also keep track of all characters and their actions, so
long as they do not leave the place for more than a brief moment.

The Storyteller must inform the character of any suspicious movements,
or disappearances of characters in the scene.

 Performance
-----------

### Dance of Flashing Swords

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** 1m

After the fact, the Exalt can explain away that a particularly egregious
action—a fight, explosion, or similar altercation—as a spontaneous act
of street performance. Most will accept this at face value, but gain a
Moderate Advantage to convince others.

### Irresistible Diversion

**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Cost:** 2m

The performer can command attention to themselves, making sure that they
and only they are noticed by onlookers. Characters with less (Essence)
than the Exalt cannot turn their eyes away from the performance until it
is finished, and others can be entranced by a successful Performance vs.
Resolve roll.

### Mood-Inducing Music

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 1m

The Exalt provides appropriate music, inflaming or dampening emotions in
the scene. Attempts to Influence, Instill, or otherwise capitalize on
Emotion are granted a Moderate Advantage or Disadvantage, at the choice
of the Player.

### Phantom Scenery

**Type:** Supplemental; Scene  
**Cost:** 1m

The Exalt may conjure scenery, props, or other phantoms as extensions of
their anima, showing up as distorted, shadowy figures. In typical
application, such as on stage or during a structured performance, this
illusion does not arouse suspicion of the Exalt’s nature—people will be
primed to believe this is just stage magic. In other circumstances, the
Exalt must use a contested (Performance) vs. (Awareness) roll to
disguise this as a mundane effect.

### Shining Expression Style

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** 1m

The Exalt embodies a specific Emotion, folding it perfectly into their
performance. All who watch are struck with the raw power of that
emotion, and cannot help but resonate.

Any who view this with a Resolve less than (Essence)—including their
allies—will openly display an Intimacy related to the Emotion.

### Soul-Firing Performance

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 1m

A performance can speak directly to each individual, as though it were a
one on one conversation. With a Performance Roll, ignore any Resolve
bonus from being in a Group.

 Socialize
---------

### Dauntless Assayer Method

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 1m

The Exalt, on failing a Read Intentions roll, may try their roll again.
The Player must describe a small action that allows for a new roll, from
spilling a drink, readjusting their observing position, or simply
clearing their mind.

### Discretionary Gesture

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 1m

A chain is only as strong as its weakest link—a fact known by any in the
socialite circles. Through subtle (and not-so subtle) means, the Exalt
can interrupt an interrogation of one of their compatriots, using their
own Resolve in place of their Ally’s.

### Easily-Discarded Presence

**Type:** Reflexive; Scene  
**Cost:** 2m

It is easy to make people believe what they want to see. On activating
this charm, the Exalt specifies a false Intimacy or intent, which is
seen as truth to any who fails a “Read Intention” action against the
Exalt.

### Excellent Friend Approach

**Type:** Permanent

The charms of the Exalt are hard to resist. So long as there is no
specific reason against it, Mortals and beings with (Essence) lower than
the Exalt’s will be friendly and cordial to them, even if they have just
met, and they gain +2 dice on their first Social roll against a target.

### Irresistible Salesman Spirit

**Type:** Simple; Day  
**Cost:** 2m

On a successful Socialize roll, instill a near-obsession level of
fascination, idea, or desire for a product in the target—so long as it
does not conflict with an existing Intimacy.

For a day, the target(s) gain an Intimacy towards the specified product,
and will attempt to pursue it, potentially leaving their posts or other
aspects of their life temporarily behind.

### Mastery of Small Manners

**Type:** Reflexive; Scene  
**Cost:** 1m

The Exalt may quickly understand and emulate local mannerisms and
customs, ensuring that they blend into the society around them. They
suffer no ill effects from being an outsider, quickly acclimating to and
understanding new customs with but a simple glance.

 Subterfuge
----------

### Mimicry of Form

**Type:** Simple; Week  
**Cost:** 2m

After studying a mannerism of a target for a short time, such as
handwriting, voice, or even walking pattern, the Exalt may replicate it
as needed for a week, gaining (3) additional dice to do so.

### Hidden Meaning

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 2m

The Exalt hides their true meaning in inflections, allusions, and other
roundabout ways of speaking, writing, or other methods of communication.

The intended contact will be the only one who can divine the true
meaning of the conversation, but others may make a contested roll
(Cunning + Investigation) vs. the Exalt’s (Cunning + Subterfuge) to
notice that there is a coded message.

### False Pursuit

**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Cost:** 2m

On a successful (Charisma + Deception) roll against the Resolve of a
target, they become convinced that an ultimately benign or small point
of the Scene holds great value to their current goal. For example, they
may be convinced that the blades used murder are made of a special
composition, which is a keystone to their case, despite the blades being
only slightly out of normal make.

### Flashing Quill Atemi

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** 1m

With just a short moment in possession of a written text, the Exalt may
insert, expunge, or replace words as they see fit. No mundane means or
mortal characters will be able decipher the difference between the
altered content.

An Exalt, God, or other creature of power must successfully contest the
Guile of the forging Exalt to notice that the document has been altered
at all—let alone what specifically has been altered.

### Mind-Wiping Gaze

**Type:** Reflexive; Scene  
**Cost:** 3m

The Exalt pierces the target with a gaze that penetrates the very soul,
extinguishing the flame of memories.

Interrupt a target taking a Social Influence action, or who is
attempting to communicate in a way. On a successful Subterfuge vs.
Resolve roll, the target loses their thoughts and memories regarding
their action and immediately fails on their action. In addition, they
cannot remember to pick the task up again until after the scene. This
may only be done once per scene.

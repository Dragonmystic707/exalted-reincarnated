Quick **<span class="smallcaps">Characters</span>**
---------------------------------------------------

The following is a table to help create characters on the fly, as needed
for the campaign. These should be considered base value statistics, and
do not include any bonuses from, say, armor and weapons.

 Quick Powers
------------

The following powers are quick ways to bring an antagonist to life
without the need for a full character sheet—almost all of the
antagonists you have will probably be made this way.

These powers are not for player use, as they are intended to be as
flexible as possible for the situation. These *represent* the various
charms, martial arts, etc. of the system while letting you decide on the
restriction level.

These should be used *on top* of base-level mechanics, such as Maneuvers
or

### Specialty

Choose something that the character is specialized in, and then add +2
dice/+1 defense to any rolls made in that specialty. This is considered
their base dice pool.

### Quick Reflexes

Immediately respond to an action before any other character has a chance
to act. Perform a contested (Dex + Athletics) against other characters
if you believe this should be contested.

### Ferocious Bite

Spend a Maneuver focusing an attack. On the next Strike, deal an extra
(+4/2) damage.

### Cloak in Shadows

Perform an action to disappear from the senses of the group. You may
perform a contested roll—if you fail, you only partially disappear. Weak
versions can only stay in the shadows for a turn, and get revealed if
they take an action. Advanced versions allow indefinite actions and time
in the cloaked shadows.

This can take the form of a spirit dematerializing, animals hiding in
the underbrush, or people disappearing into a crowd.

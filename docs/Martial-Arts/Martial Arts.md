Martial Arts are sets of Powers that are wholly dedicated to the art of
war. While there may be some limited use outside of the battlefield,
those uses will be secondary and at the ruling of the Storyteller.

### Sources

Martial Arts, as opposed to other sources of Power, have more
restrictions on how the powers may be purchased. Martial Arts are
specific, techniques that are codified, named, and trained as knowledge
passed from teacher to student.

Martial Arts Techniques *must* be learned in the order presented,
starting with the Form Technique, and a Player should be able to point
to a specific mentor (typically a Merit) that they have learned the
techniques from.

### Form Technique

The first Technique of a Martial Arts is always the style’s Form, which
details out the way a practitioner moves and acts during combat, and the
bonuses they get from doing so.

When combat starts, characters immediately drop into their Form
stance—it is instinctual and the same as readying weapons. They do not
need to take a specific action to do so.

Form Techniques are *mutually exclusive*, you cannot have more than one
active at a time. As well, any Style techniques may *only* be used while
in its Style Form—you cannot be in Tiger Form and use Snake Style
Techniques, for example.

If you know more than one Martial Arts style, switching form styles is a
diceless Maneuver.

#### Form Abilities

The Martial Arts will draw upon and enhance *associated Abilities* for
its techniques. Performing the Martial Arts without training in these
abilities is unadvised. Some Styles will even rely on Supernatural
Abilities, such as shapeshifting, and cannot be taken if the character
does not have access to the associated ability.

#### Form Armor and Weapons

Form Styles restrict what sorts of weapons and armor the Stylist
uses—after all, it would be all but impossible to take the light,
dancing maneuvers of Snake Style in restrictive Heavy Plate!

As well, the Martial Arts Style may require Unarmed or Ranged weapons to
perform their actions. The weight class or bonuses of a weapon are not
restricted, only the presence of one and that they are compatible with
the

As well, the Martial Arts will often detail of the shape and type of
weapon used during combat. This is simply a suggestion to what the
Martial Arts should look like.

Fists of the Street Style
-------------------------

**Abilities** Brawl  
**Armor** Unarmored, Light  
**Weapons** Unarmed

There is one Martial Arts Style that *does not* require a mentor—or
rather, the mentor is simply the rough teacher that is Creation herself.
Many of her inhabitants will learn a psuedo-style of fighting that
naturally enhances their own attacks and defense. This is (often
derogatorily) called the “Fists of the Street” Style—even though there
is little unifying facets of the style.

This Martial Arts is unique in that has no techniques past the Form.
However, it is a favorite among those who wish to become an unarmed
champion with little effort.

Lesser Techniques

### Fists of the Street Form

**Type:** Form

The Stylist takes on a stance that they themselves have honed over
countless battles, their hardened body ready to take on anything thrown
at them.

Your unarmed Strikes become as strong as either Light or Medium weapons,
while retaining their Natural tag. As well, you gain +1 Soak.

Snake Style
-----------

**Abilities** Brawl, Athletics  
**Armor** Unarmored, Light  
**Weapons** Unarmed (Hand Needles)

Snake stylists use quick, precise strikes, disrupting Chakras and the
flow of their targets motions. They prey on those that are slower than
them. Masters can even deliver paralyzing poisonous Essence through
their fingertips, or through specialized hollow hand needles.

#### Hand Needles

Hand Needles are specialized equipment made specifically for
practitioners of this Style. They are finger-length hollow needles,
typically made of strengthened glass, wood, or obsidian, that allow for
quick piercing strikes. Trainees often use harmless chopsticks as their
practice weapons. Masters know how to use simply their bare fingers for
this style.

Lesser Techniques

### Snake Form

**Type:** Form

The stylist takes on the form of the ever-ready, unpredictable snake,
one hand open and ready, and their body sinuous, flexible, and with
unpredictable motion.

Gain +1 Evasion. Additionally, by spending 1m you may *choose* when to
act during a Round, interrupting between character turns. However, this
will cause you to take 1 action instead of 2.

### Armor-Penetrating Fang

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 1m

The Stylist knows how to precisely strike to deliver their devastating
results, whether it be between joints in armor or in targeted weak
spots.

Make a Brawl Strike vs. Evasion. If you miss, you still deal Glancing
damage so long as you roll at least 1 success.

### Bindings of the Serpent

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 2a

The serpent within uncoils in a brilliant flash of essence, striking at
those whom are unready.

Perform a Brawl Strike against a target whom *has not acted* yet in this
Round. If you hit, immediately deal +(Essence) additional damage, and
bind the target, preventing them from moving. They must expend a
Contested Maneuver against your (Dexterity + Athletics) to escape the
ever-moving coils.

Greater Techniques

### Countless Coils Evasion

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 2a

The Stylist is ever moving, nearly impossible to pin down nor target
with attacks.

After being hit, roll (Dexterity + Athletics). Reduce the amount of
damage you take by the number of rolled successes. If you reduce the
amount to 0, the attack is considered to have not hit in the first
place.

### Crippling Pressure-Point Strike

**Type:** Supplemental; Scene  
**Cost:** 2m

With a rapid succession of strikes, the Stylist targets nerve clusters
and pressure points with startling precision and with enough force to
completely numb a limb.

Perform a (Dexterity + Brawl) vs. Evasion Maneuver against a target
*whom has not acted yet this Round*. If you successfully hit, paralyze a
limb for the remainder of the Scene. They suffer (-2) on all actions
that would normally use such a limb—representing them using their
non-dominant hand for attacks, for example.

Capstone Technique

### Essence Venom Strike

**Type:** Supplemental; Week  
**Cost:** 4a

Vile venom fills the soul of the Serpent stylist, ready to be injected
into their prey.

Once per Week, you may deliver an envenomed blow on a target with a
Brawl Strike. So long as you hit—even with a glancing blow—the target
becomes poisoned, ensuring a most assured death—if not now, then later.

Each turn that the target takes action, they lose 3 Health. Should they
manage to survive through the end of combat, they will still slowly lose
their Health, and become unable to regain it through normal rest. A
Scale 2 Medicine Project must be undertaken to cure the toxin, or by
Cheating Death.

The same target cannot be repeatedly be envenomed in the same Season.

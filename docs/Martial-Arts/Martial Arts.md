Martial Arts are sets of Powers that are wholly dedicated to the art of
war. While there may be some limited use outside of the battlefield,
those uses will be secondary and at the ruling of the Storyteller.

### Sources

Martial Arts, as opposed to other sources of Power, have more
restrictions on how the powers may be purchased. Martial Arts are
specific, techniques that are codified, named, and trained as knowledge
passed from teacher to student.

Martial Arts Techniques *must* be learned in the order presented,
starting with the Form Technique, and a Player should be able to point
to a specific mentor (typically a Merit) that they have learned the
techniques from.

<p>Mortals have a proud tradition of teaching and practicing the Martial Arts presented, but they do not have the Essence required to utilize the techniques to their full extent.</p>
<p>Even the rare Heroic Mortal Master may be able to empower the Lesser Techniques, but they would not be able to use the Greater or Capstone Techniques intended.</p>
<p>Instead, they learn the motions of the techniques, without the power behind it. It does have a marked benefit to them, but not on the scale of the Exalted, and so is not mechanically represented.</p>

### Form Technique

The first Technique of a Martial Arts is always the style’s Form, which
details out the way a practitioner moves and acts during combat, and the
bonuses they get from doing so.

When combat starts, characters immediately drop into their Form
stance—it is instinctual and the same as readying weapons. They do not
need to take a specific action to do so.

Form Techniques are *mutually exclusive*, you cannot have more than one
active at a time. As well, any Style techniques may *only* be used while
in its Style Form—you cannot be in Tiger Form and use Snake Style
Techniques, for example.

If you know more than one Martial Arts style, switching form styles is a
diceless Maneuver.

#### Form Abilities

The Martial Arts will draw upon and enhance *associated Abilities* for
its techniques. Performing the Martial Arts without training in these
abilities is unadvised. Some Styles will even rely on Supernatural
Abilities, such as shapeshifting, and cannot be taken if the character
does not have access to the associated ability.

#### Form Armor and Weapons

Form Styles restrict what sorts of weapons and armor the Stylist
uses—after all, it would be all but impossible to take the light,
dancing maneuvers of Snake Style in restrictive Heavy Plate!

As well, the Martial Arts Style may require Unarmed or Ranged weapons to
perform their actions. The weight class or bonuses of a weapon are not
restricted, only the presence of one and that they are compatible with
the

As well, the Martial Arts will often detail of the shape and type of
weapon used during combat. This is simply a suggestion to what the
Martial Arts should look like.

Fists of the Street Style
-------------------------

**Abilities** Brawl  
**Armor** Unarmored, Light  
**Weapons** Unarmed

There is one Martial Arts Style that *does not* require a mentor—or
rather, the mentor is simply the rough teacher that is life on Creation
herself. Many of her inhabitants will learn a psuedo-style of fighting
that naturally enhances their own attacks and defense. This is (often
derogatorily) called the “Fists of the Street” Style—even though there
is little unifying facets of the style.

This Martial Arts is unique in that has no techniques past the Form.
However, it is a favorite among those who wish to become an unarmed
champion with little effort.

<div class="power_category">Lesser Techniques</div>

### Fists of the Street Form

**Type:** Form

The Stylist takes on a stance that they themselves have honed over
countless battles, their hardened body ready to take on anything thrown
at them.

Your unarmed Strikes become as strong as either Light or Medium weapons,
while retaining their Natural tag. As well, you gain +1 Soak.

Snake Style
-----------

**Abilities** Brawl, Athletics  
**Armor** Unarmored, Light  
**Weapons** Unarmed (Hand Needles)

Snake stylists use quick, precise strikes, disrupting Chakras and the
flow of their targets motions. They prey on those that are slower than
them. Masters can even deliver paralyzing poisonous Essence through
their fingertips, or through specialized hollow hand needles.

#### Hand Needles

Hand Needles are specialized equipment made specifically for
practitioners of this Style. They are finger-length hollow needles,
typically made of strengthened glass, wood, or obsidian, that allow for
quick piercing strikes. Trainees often use harmless chopsticks as their
practice weapons. Masters know how to use simply their bare fingers for
this style.

Hand needles have no mechanical benefit.

<div class="power_category">Lesser Techniques</div>

### Snake Form

**Type:** Form

The stylist takes on the form of the ever-ready, unpredictable snake,
one hand open and ready, and their body sinuous, flexible, and with
unpredictable motion.

Gain +1 Evasion. Additionally, by spending 1m you may *choose* when to
act during a Round, interrupting between character turns. However, this
will cause you to take 1 action instead of 2.

### Armor-Penetrating Fang

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 1m

The Stylist knows how to precisely strike to deliver their devastating
results, whether it be between joints in armor or in targeted weak
spots.

Make a Brawl Strike vs. Evasion. If you miss, you still deal Glancing
damage so long as you roll at least 1 success.

### Bindings of the Serpent

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 2a

The serpent within uncoils in a brilliant flash of essence, striking at
those whom are unready.

Perform a Brawl Strike against a target whom *has not acted* yet in this
Round. If you hit, immediately deal +(Essence) additional damage, and
bind the target, preventing them from moving. They must expend a
Contested Maneuver against your (Dexterity + Athletics) to escape the
ever-moving coils.

<div class="power_category">Greater Techniques</div>

### Countless Coils Evasion

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 2a

The Stylist is ever moving, nearly impossible to pin down nor target
with attacks.

After being hit, roll (Dexterity + Athletics). *This roll cannot be
boosted by any means*. Reduce the amount of damage you take by the
number of rolled successes. If you reduce the amount to 0, the attack is
considered to have not hit in the first place.

### Crippling Pressure-Point Strike

**Type:** Supplemental; Scene  
**Cost:** 2m

With a rapid succession of strikes, the Stylist targets nerve clusters
and pressure points with startling precision and with enough force to
completely numb a limb.

Perform a (Dexterity + Brawl) vs. Evasion Maneuver against a target
*whom has not acted yet this Round*. If you successfully hit, paralyze a
limb for the remainder of the Scene. They suffer (-2) on all actions
that would normally use such a limb—representing them using their
non-dominant hand for attacks, for example.

<div class="power_category">Capstone Technique</div>

### Essence Venom Strike

**Type:** Supplemental; Week  
**Cost:** 4a

Vile venom fills the soul of the Serpent stylist, ready to be injected
into their prey.

Once per Week, you may deliver an envenomed blow on a target with a
Brawl Strike. So long as you hit—even with a glancing blow—the target
becomes poisoned, ensuring a most assured death—if not now, then later.

Each turn that the target takes action, they lose 3 Health. Should they
manage to survive through the end of combat, they will still slowly lose
their Health, and become unable to regain it through normal rest. A
Scale 2 Medicine Project must be undertaken to cure the toxin, or by
Cheating Death.

The same target cannot be repeatedly be envenomed in the same Season.

Tiger Style
-----------

**Abilities** Brawl, Athletics  
**Armor** Unarmored, Light  
**Weapons** Unarmed, Fist Weapons

Tiger Stylists focus on a low-centered, wide stances, which provides
both incredible balance and flexibility in their motions. Their actions
are fluid and active, using their entire body in their motion full of
rolls, kicks, and extensive footwork. It is not uncommon for Tiger
Stylists to use the environment to their advantage, leaping off of walls
and rafters in a ravaging pounce.

The path of the Tiger follows the life of the great cat—the young are
quick, agile, and reflexive, while as they age they become terrifying
predators with immense damage—but never losing the agility of their
young selves.

Tiger Stylists are known to be brutal teachers, focusing on outcome and
results rather than pleasantries and inner peace. The style has
therefore developed a bit of a dour reputation—often used in theatrical
productions to show cruel villains or terrifying overloards.

<div class="power_category">Lesser Techniques</div>

### Tiger Form

**Type:** Form

The Tiger Stylist is ever ready, no matter the terrain or their
position. They do not need to roll to cross unsteady or moving terrain,
and never suffer penalties from being knocked down.

### Retreating Momentum

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 1m

When attacked, the Stylist whirls around and uses the momentum of the
incoming attack to propel themselves backwards.

On an incoming attack, reduce the damage received by 3. However, you are
knocked-back a range band, at the discretion of the attacker.

### Crimson Leaping Cat

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 2m

Leaping from afar, the Stylist crashes into their opponent with immense
rage and fury, bringing the fury of the Tiger upon their target.

This technique must be used on the same Turn in which you move towards
the opponent. Supplement a Decisive Strike, dealing (+3/2) damage and
stunning the target on a hit.

<div class="power_category">Greater Techniques</div>

### Prey-Maiming Frenzy

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 2a

The Stylist channels the sheer strength of the Tiger, ravaging their
opponent with frenzied, brutal strikes.

Against any target that is stunned, paralyzed, or otherwise held in
place, deal an extra (+4/3) damage.

### Bone-Shattering Bite

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 3a

After delivering a successful Strike, the Stylist sinks their
metaphorical teeth into the wound, shattering the bones of their target.

So long as the target has lost at least 5 Health from one of your
attacks (as calculated after all powers), you may disable a limb of the
target by breaking a bone. While that limb is broken, they suffer (-2)
on all actions that would normally use such a limb—representing them
using their non-dominant hand for attacks, for example.

Healing a broken bone faster than a year requires a Medicine Project of
Scale 1.

**Capstone Technique**

### Angry Predator Frenzy

**Type:** Permanent

The tiger is the apex Predator of the jungle, stalker of all those
around them. Where they travel, others dare not walk in their
footsteps—for the great tiger slinks roughly through the underbrush,
ready to strike.

When in Tiger Form, add (+2) dice to any Athletics rolls, and add (+3/1)
damage to their attacks.

Single Point Shining into the Void Style
----------------------------------------

**Abilities** Melee, Integrity  
**Armor** Light, Medium  
**Weapons** Slashing Swords

Those Stylists who choose to be a Single Point of light among the
darkness that reins in Creation must dedicate themselves to the purity
of form itself. They must know their own inner truth before being
inducted into this style—if they cannot bear the burden of their own
self, they cannot bear the burden of the rest of the world on their
shoulders.

Stylists are known to be decisive, quick, and only move with purpose.
Rarely do they even unsheathe their weapons except to deliver a
singular, killing blow, only to return their pristine steel back as
quickly as it is drawn.

<div class="power_category">Lesser Techniques</div>

### Single Point Shining into the Void Form

**Type:** Form

The stylist does not draw their weapons without purpose. To not throw
everything behind their attacks would be foolishly brandishing their
weapon about.

You may use both actions on your turn as Decisive Strikes. However, on
your next turn you may only take Maneuvers.

As well, the Stylist always deals an extra (+1/1) damage to [Creatures
of Darkness](creatures-of-darkness).

### Gathering Light Concentration

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 1m

The posture of the Stylist shows the dedication to their craft, and even
those who do not know of their reputation will understand quickly how to
fear this creature.

Whenever using Melee on any Maneuver, such as Building Power or
Intimidation, gain (+2) dice to such efforts.

### Shining Star Execution

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 1m

The Stylist becomes a whirl of steel, flowing from one target to the
next in a blur of motion that becomes impossible to predict.

When attacking twice in a round, gain +2 dice and (+2/1) damage on your
second attack, so long as you attack a different target than the first.

<div class="power_category">Greater Techniques</div>

### Six-Demon Scabbard Binding

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 3m

The Stylist knows the truth of their own soul, and also knows when those
around them seek to twist it to their own bindings—even subconsciously.

While in the heat of battle, actively roll (Wits + Integrity), with
(Essence) extra dice, against any attempts to supernaturally warp,
twist, shape, or otherwise change the mind, spirit, or body of the
Stylist instead of using Resolve or any other specified defense.

If the Stylist successfully defends against this attack with 3 successes
more than their attacker, they may turn the attack back on their
assailant.

### Horizon-Swallowed Star Flash

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 3a

The stylist knows that, often, aggressors will drop their defenses in
the moment of their unbridled rage present in an attack.

When either defending another or being attacked directly, roll
(Dexterity + Integrity) vs. the target’s Evasion. If you are successful,
immediately deliver your Full Damage as a preemptive counterattack,
resolved before the target has a chance to deliver their attack.

**Capstone Technique**

### Blinding Nova Flare

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** 4a

The Stylist strikes with overwhelming speed and spiritual prowess that
erupts into a glowing sphere of destruction.

Once per Scene, erupt into a brilliant nova of blinding light that
resonates with your Exaltation. All foes in the scene who witness this
eruption suffer (-2) dice on all their actions.

As well, choose a target to focus your fury on, and roll contested (Wits
+ Integrity). If you succeed, their Evasion drops by (3) for the
remainder of the fight, as you focus your inner soul on defeating them
no matter the cost.

White Reaper Style
------------------

**Abilities** Melee, Physique  
**Armor** Any  
**Weapons** Scythes, Polearms, Staves

The origins of the White Reaper style lays with the humble farmers, who
took up their instruments of craft to face the innumerable hordes of
Wyld troops that sought to destroy and defile their land, their
livelihoods, and their lives. Despite all odds, they managed to turn the
tides, keeping their lands from the flood of the Wyld.

To this day, the White Reaper Style stands as a testament of the strong
spirit of those that are typically powerless, and how one may stand
against a seemingly endless wave of enemies. It is particularly popular
among Lunars of the northeastern cities, who have perfected the style
into its current form.

<div class="power_category">Lesser Techniques</div>

### White Reaper Form

**Type:** Form

The Reaper stands strong against a thousand faceless hoards, empowered
by the uneven odds as a misty white halo of energy coalesces around them
with every strike.

Gain (+2) accuracy and (+2/1) damage on Strikes against Battle Groups.
As well, whenever you successfully Strike a Battle Group, immediately
gain 1 Anima. You also gain 1 Anima every time any enemy is defeated by
your Strike.

### Falling Scythe Flash

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 1m

The Strikes of a White Reaper do not fall except for the purpose of
harvesting their foes. Deal an extra (Strength)/2 damage on Full Hit.
Against Battle Groups, instead deal an extra (Strength) damage.

### Revolving Crescent Defense

**Type:** Permanent

The Stylist whirls their scythe in a complex pattern of moving steel and
wood, providing a parry against all that would strike against them.

Gain Parry, a third defense, which is calculated as (Strength +
Melee)/2.

<div class="power_category">Greater Techniques</div>

### Enemies Like Grass

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** (2a per target)

As the corona of blinding white light surrounds the Stylist, they lash
out and strike at all whom dare stand in their way, halos of light
erupting and crashing into their foes.

You may target up to (Essence) foes, spending 2 Anima per target. These
targets may be in the same and/or adjacent Zones. Lash out and attack
them with a singular roll, gaining (+2) accuracy, and (+3/2) damage.

### Snow Follows Winter

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** (1a per 3hp)

The Stylist knows that combat against an endless horde is one of
attrition, and constantly reinforces them with the energy harvested from
the fallen.

Immediately pull in a white halo of light from fallen foes into
yourself—gaining 3 health for every 1 Anima spent.

<div class="power_category">Capstone Technique</div>

### Greatest Killer Attitude

**Type:** Permanent

The flow and ebb of battle becomes ingrained into the Stylist, and the
energies stolen from fallen enemies bolsters the swath of death, fueling
the cold inevitability of battle. The White corona of death surrounds
the stylist, draping them further and further into the agent of the End.

Each time a foe or Battle Group is defeated, gain (+2 acc), (+1/1)
damage until the end of the Scene.

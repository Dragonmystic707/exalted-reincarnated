Martial Arts are sets of Powers that are wholly dedicated to the art of
war. While there may be some limited use outside of the battlefield,
those uses will be secondary and at the ruling of the Storyteller.

### Sources

Martial Arts, as opposed to other sources of Power, have more
restrictions on how the powers may be purchased. Martial Arts are
specific, techniques that are codified, named, and trained as knowledge
passed from teacher to student.

Martial Arts Techniques *must* be learned in the order presented,
starting with the Form Technique, and a Player should be able to point
to a specific mentor (typically a Merit) that they have learned the
techniques from.

<p>Mortals have a proud tradition of teaching and practicing the Martial Arts presented, but they do not have the Essence required to utilize the techniques to their full extent.</p>

<p>Instead, they learn the motions of the techniques, without the power behind it. It does have a marked benefit to them, but not on the scale of the Exalted, and so is not mechanically represented.</p>

### Form Technique

The first Technique of a Martial Arts is always the style’s Form, which
details out the way a practitioner moves and acts during combat, and the
bonuses they get from doing so.

When combat starts, characters immediately drop into their Form
stance—it is instinctual and the same as readying weapons. They do not
need to take a specific action to do so.

Form Techniques are *mutually exclusive*, you cannot have more than one
active at a time. As well, any Style techniques may *only* be used while
in its Style Form—you cannot be in Tiger Form and use Snake Style
Techniques, for example.

If you know more than one Martial Arts style, switching form styles is a
diceless Maneuver.

#### Form Abilities

The Martial Arts will draw upon and enhance *associated Abilities* for
its techniques. Performing the Martial Arts without training in these
abilities is unadvised. Some Styles will even rely on Supernatural
Abilities, such as shapeshifting, and cannot be taken if the character
does not have access to the associated ability.

#### Form Armor and Weapons

Form Styles restrict what sorts of weapons and armor the Stylist
uses—after all, it would be all but impossible to take the light,
dancing maneuvers of Snake Style in restrictive Heavy Plate!

As well, the Martial Arts Style may require Unarmed or Ranged weapons to
perform their actions. The weight class or bonuses of a weapon are not
restricted, only the presence of one and that they are compatible with
the

As well, the Martial Arts will often detail of the shape and type of
weapon used during combat. This is simply a suggestion to what the
Martial Arts should look like.

Fists of the Street Style
-------------------------

**Abilities** Brawl  
**Armor** Unarmored, Light  
**Weapons** Unarmed

There is one Martial Arts Style that *does not* require a mentor—or
rather, the mentor is simply the rough teacher that is life on Creation
herself. Many of her inhabitants will learn a psuedo-style of fighting
that naturally enhances their own attacks and defense. This is (often
derogatorily) called the “Fists of the Street” Style—even though there
is little unifying facets of the style.

This Martial Arts is unique in that has no techniques past the Form.
However, it is a favorite among those who wish to become an unarmed
champion with little effort.

<div class="power_category">Lesser Techniques</div>

### Fists of the Street Form

**Type:** Form

The Stylist takes on a stance that they themselves have honed over
countless battles, their hardened body ready to take on anything thrown
at them.

Your unarmed Strikes become as strong as either Light or Medium weapons,
while retaining their Natural tag. As well, you gain +1 Soak.

Snake Style
-----------

**Abilities** Brawl, Athletics  
**Armor** Unarmored, Light  
**Weapons** Unarmed (Hand Needles)

Snake stylists use quick, precise strikes, disrupting Chakras and the
flow of their targets motions. They prey on those that are slower than
them. Masters can even deliver paralyzing poisonous Essence through
their fingertips, or through specialized hollow hand needles.

#### Hand Needles

Hand Needles are specialized equipment made specifically for
practitioners of this Style. They are finger-length hollow needles,
typically made of strengthened glass, wood, or obsidian, that allow for
quick piercing strikes. Trainees often use harmless chopsticks as their
practice weapons. Masters know how to use simply their bare fingers for
this style.

<div class="power_category">Lesser Techniques</div>

### Snake Form

**Type:** Form

The stylist takes on the form of the ever-ready, unpredictable snake,
one hand open and ready, and their body sinuous, flexible, and with
unpredictable motion.

Gain +1 Evasion. Additionally, by spending 1m you may *choose* when to
act during a Round, interrupting between character turns. However, this
will cause you to take 1 action instead of 2.

### Armor-Penetrating Fang

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 1m

The Stylist knows how to precisely strike to deliver their devastating
results, whether it be between joints in armor or in targeted weak
spots.

Make a Brawl Strike vs. Evasion. If you miss, you still deal Glancing
damage so long as you roll at least 1 success.

### Bindings of the Serpent

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 2a

The serpent within uncoils in a brilliant flash of essence, striking at
those whom are unready.

Perform a Brawl Strike against a target whom *has not acted* yet in this
Round. If you hit, immediately deal +(Essence) additional damage, and
bind the target, preventing them from moving. They must expend a
Contested Maneuver against your (Dexterity + Athletics) to escape the
ever-moving coils.

<div class="power_category">Greater Techniques</div>

### Countless Coils Evasion

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 2a

The Stylist is ever moving, nearly impossible to pin down nor target
with attacks.

After being hit, roll (Dexterity + Athletics). *This roll cannot be
boosted by any means*. Reduce the amount of damage you take by the
number of rolled successes. If you reduce the amount to 0, the attack is
considered to have not hit in the first place.

### Crippling Pressure-Point Strike

**Type:** Supplemental; Scene  
**Cost:** 2m

With a rapid succession of strikes, the Stylist targets nerve clusters
and pressure points with startling precision and with enough force to
completely numb a limb.

Perform a (Dexterity + Brawl) vs. Evasion Maneuver against a target
*whom has not acted yet this Round*. If you successfully hit, paralyze a
limb for the remainder of the Scene. They suffer (-2) on all actions
that would normally use such a limb—representing them using their
non-dominant hand for attacks, for example.

<div class="power_category">Capstone Technique</div>

### Essence Venom Strike

**Type:** Supplemental; Week  
**Cost:** 4a

Vile venom fills the soul of the Serpent stylist, ready to be injected
into their prey.

Once per Week, you may deliver an envenomed blow on a target with a
Brawl Strike. So long as you hit—even with a glancing blow—the target
becomes poisoned, ensuring a most assured death—if not now, then later.

Each turn that the target takes action, they lose 3 Health. Should they
manage to survive through the end of combat, they will still slowly lose
their Health, and become unable to regain it through normal rest. A
Scale 2 Medicine Project must be undertaken to cure the toxin, or by
Cheating Death.

The same target cannot be repeatedly be envenomed in the same Season.

Tiger Style
-----------

**Abilities** Brawl, Athletics  
**Armor** Unarmored, Light  
**Weapons** Unarmed, Fist Weapons

Tiger Stylists focus on a low-centered, wide stances, which provides
both incredible balance and flexibility in their motions. Their actions
are fluid and active, using their entire body in their motion full of
rolls, kicks, and extensive footwork. It is not uncommon for Tiger
Stylists to use the environment to their advantage, leaping off of walls
and rafters in a ravaging pounce.

The path of the Tiger follows the life of the great cat—the young are
quick, agile, and reflexive, while as they age they become terrifying
predators with immense damage—but never losing the agility of their
young selves.

Tiger Stylists are known to be brutal teachers, focusing on outcome and
results rather than pleasantries and inner peace. The style has
therefore developed a bit of a dour reputation—often used in theatrical
productions to show cruel villains or terrifying overloards.

<div class="power_category">Lesser Techniques</div>

### Tiger Form

**Type:** Form

The Tiger Stylist is ever ready, no matter the terrain or their
position. They do not need to roll to cross unsteady or moving terrain,
and never suffer penalties from being knocked down.

### Retreating Momentum

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 1m

When attacked, the Stylist whirls around and uses the momentum of the
incoming attack to propel themselves backwards.

On an incoming attack, reduce the damage received by 3. However, you are
knocked-back a range band, at the discretion of the attacker.

### Crimson Leaping Cat

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 2m

Leaping from afar, the Stylist crashes into their opponent with immense
rage and fury, bringing the fury of the Tiger upon their target.

This technique must be used on the same Turn in which you move towards
the opponent. Supplement a Decisive Strike, dealing (+3/2) damage and
stunning the target on a hit.

<div class="power_category">Greater Techniques</div>

### Prey-Maiming Frenzy

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 2a

The Stylist channels the sheer strength of the Tiger, ravaging their
opponent with frenzied, brutal strikes.

Against any target that is stunned, paralyzed, or otherwise held in
place, deal an extra (+4/3) damage.

### Bone-Shattering Bite

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 3a

After delivering a successful Strike, the Stylist sinks their
metaphorical teeth into the wound, shattering the bones of their target.

So long as the target has lost at least 5 Health from one of your
attacks (as calculated after all powers), you may disable a limb of the
target by breaking a bone. While that limb is broken, they suffer (-2)
on all actions that would normally use such a limb—representing them
using their non-dominant hand for attacks, for example.

Healing a broken bone faster than a year requires a Medicine Project of
Scale 1.

**Capstone Technique**

### Angry Predator Frenzy

**Type:** Permanent

The tiger is the apex Predator of the jungle, stalker of all those
around them.

When in Tiger Form, add (+2) dice to any Athletics checks, and add
(+3/1) damage to their attacks.

If the target is of (Essence) less than the Solar, the target becomes
blinded for the remainder of the Scene.

### Flawlessly Impenetrable Disguise

**Type:** Simple; Day  
**Cost:** 2m

Through clever trickery, the Solar manages to craft a disguise that
appears to break physical limitations, such as appearing shorter,
gaining extreme mutations such as functional extra pairs of arms, or
gain a voice that could not come from their body.

While impressive and fooling to all inspection—even detailed—it is still
just well-crafted trickery.

### Genius Palate Summation

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 1m

The emotions and intentions of an individual bleed through to their
craftsmanship. Upon eating, imbibing, or otherwise interacting with food
or drink prepared or handled by an individual, make a Read Intentions
Action against them.

### Mist on Water

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 1m

With a swift motion, the Solar disrupts the chakras necessary for
thought and sound, rendering the target partially paralyzed and
importantly—unable to make sound.

With either a successful touch or hit, force the target to lose their
next action, and become silenced for the next (Essence)x15 minutes.

If used in a Combat or Encounter, this silence lasts (Essence) Rounds
instead.

### <span class="smallcaps">Proof Eating Palm</span>

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 1m

The Solar disappears an object from plain sight, its resting place known
only to the Solar themselves. So long as the Solar is able to get their
hands on the object, and it is no larger than their torso, the object is
simply *gone* for at least 15 minutes.

They must successfully beat a contested Stealth vs Awareness roll
against creatures with (Essence) more than the Solar.

###  <span class="smallcaps">Sensory Acuity Prana</span>

**Type:** Reflexive; Scene  
**Cost:** 1m

The senses of the Solar become sharpened to levels beyond what a mere
mortal can reach—able to differentiate between individual voices three
buildings down, or tasting the slightest variation in flavors in food
(as would be present with the most subtle of poisons.)

On all active Awareness rolls, gain 2 dice, and rolls are now allowed
for what would be considered impossible before.

Prolonged use of this charm is often considered painful and
overwhelming, even to the mighty Chosen.

### Shadow-Crossing Leap

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 2a

The Solar may cross a threshold without disturbing anything between the
two locations. They need not set a foot down, nor do they trip any
wires, disturb dust, or even alter the air with their passing. Doors and
windows remain shut, as though they had not passed through them.

Only solid walls without any opening may halt their passage from one
location to the next.

### Sound and Scent Banishing Attitude

**Type:** Reflexive; Scene  
**Cost:** 3m

The Solar focuses their attempts at stealth onto a specific, non-visual
sense, completely eliminating it from the equation. Their footsteps may
become silent, or their scent hidden from tracking dogs. Only one sense
may be banished at a time.

### Statue Spirit Stillness

**Type:** Reflexive; Scene  
**Cost:** 1m

gain +4 dice against contested Stealth.

### Sunlight Bleeding Away

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** 1a

Take a Stealth Maneuver action vs. a Target’s (Wits + Awareness). On
success, you disappear from their sight and become unseen until your
next Action.

Multiple targets may be chosen at the same time, but doing so causes a
Moderate Disadvantage.

<div class="power_category">Greater</div>

### A Will is a Way

Type: Permanent

Even if the way forward seems to be impossible, the Solar will find a
path to their destination. Once per Story, the Player declares that they
and their companions will arrive at the specified place, no matter the
obstruction, and the Storyteller must open a path for them to follow.

### Eye of the Unconquered Sun

**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Cost:** 3a

For a Moment, the Caste Mark of the Solar flares up for all to see and
becomes a focal lens for the Inner eye, revealing all to the Lawgiver.
For that brief moment, all characters in the scene can be sensed, giving
a snapshot of their current position, and movement.

As well, roll a (Wits + Awareness). All characters in the scene with
(Essence) less or equal to the roll are valid targets for any future
perception during the scene, regardless of obstacles such as hiding
behind walls.

### Guardian Fog Approach

**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Cost:** 2m

Touch up to (Essence) companions, bringing them into the shadows with

survived—they never need worry about suffering ill effects from it
again. So long as they have imbued a dose that would

The Solar may deliberately choose to lower their defenses for such
recreational substances like alcohol.

###  One Extra Step

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 2a

There are hidden ways to any place, and the Solar may identify and
pursue them immediately with none of their fellows the wiser.

Once per Scene, the Exalt may reach a Position or Target they can
observe, and which is not completely impossible to reach.

### Perfect Mirror

**Type:** Simple; Day  
**Cost:** 3m

Choose a target that the Solar has studied for at least a few hours, and
then become a perfect replica. All mannerisms and characteristics of the
target are replicated, and a surface level of knowledge and abilities
the target knows—enough to fool all but the most intimate of
acquaintances.

Even supernatural effects—such as a Anima flare, is emulated with
Essence-based illusions.

### Phantom Rider’s Retreat

**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Cost:** 2m

The Solar leads their party to safety. So long as their mode of
transportation does not halt movement, their pursuers will be unable to
catch them.

The Solar cannot rest while the effects of this charm are active, nor
regain motes.

### The Mark of Judgment

**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Cost:** 2a

The Solar marks a specific target they can perceive, burning their
target’s soul into their mind.

For the remainder of the scene, the target’s location will be known to
the Solar, no matter their distance nor intervening environmental
factors.

<div class="power_category">Capstone</div>

### False Image Feint

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Cost:** 5m

The Solar is always prepared, and knows how deception can change the
entire path of a battle.

After damage has been calculated and finalized, the Player may reveal
that the Solar had used their anima to create a false image that had
been struck—along with any object the Solar had placed to heighten the
deception.

The Player then declares where the Solar actually is—up to one Zone
away. This often will not be obvious to combatants on the field.

<div class="power_category">Lesser</div>

### Deft Official’s Way

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** 1m

After observing a group or organization in motion, the Solar may easily
pick out who would be receptive to a specified social activity, such as
socializing, intimidation, or bribery.

### Effective Counterargument

**Type:** Reflexive; Scene  
**Cost:** 1a

Once per scene, the Exalt may interrupt an other’s action to cajole,
sway, or otherwise persuade a target, rolling their own roll with
+(Essence) extra dice.

So long as the Exalt’s roll is greater than the opponent’s, the target
and those with similar mindset will gain a *negative* Intimacy towards
the original argument, inverting the intent.

### Enemy-Castigating Solar Judgment

**Type:** Supplemental  
**Cost:** 1a

Supplement a social action against a Creature of Darkness with an
additional +3 dice.

### Fury-Inciting Speech

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** 2a

Once a mob has been formed with emotions of rage, fury, or likewise, the
Solar can direct them as though they were an extension of their own
morals.

The Player directs the mob to outlet their anger. For every 3 successes
on a Social roll, the Solar can direct to the mob to take a distinct
action related to their anger, be it to burn a Guild Hall, capture a
Magistrate, or storm the docks.

### Semantic Argument Technique

**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Cost:** 2m

The Solars are known as Lawgivers, and such knowledge is intrinsic to
their very nature. During arguments involving law, procedure, or other
methodology, they gain +3 dice.

Once per Story the Solar may Recall Fact by revealing an arcane or
forgotten law without needing a roll.

###  Spurious Ownership

**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Cost:** 2a

With the force of certainty and their unconsciously regal presence,
whatever the Solar speaks claims ownership of is instinctively believed.

With a successful Social Roll vs. target’s Resolve, the target will
believe that a claimed object, structure, or even specific idea belongs
to the Solar for the remainder of the scene. This belief may remain
unless directly challenged.

If they have knowledge or direct evidence to the contrary, they instead
gain a temporary Intimacy of doubt towards their own known evidence, but
remain convinced of its true ownership.

### Wise Counsel

**Type:** Simple; Day  
**Cost:** 2m

Advise up to (Essence) characters on a specific social action, such as
specific etiquette, methodologies to charm, or ways to speak around a
subject successfully. For the remainder of the day, the target
characters may use the Solar’s social score in place of their own
whenever performing that action.

### Woe Capturing Web

**Type:** Permanent

The Solar may monitor up to (Essence) different political circles,
organizations, or groups. They will be become immediately aware of any
large-scale actions to disrupt, curse, or otherwise hinder the group in
their main goal. They will understand the basic nature of the disruption
and epicenter, but no more than that.

The choice of selected targets may be altered between Stories.

<div class="power_category">Greater</div>

### Heart-Eclipsing Shroud

**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Cost:** 2m

The Solar takes on a perfected persona, with its own intimacies,
deeply-held beliefs, intentions, and past. Any methods to divine
purpose, Read Intentions, or otherwise probe the Solar will reveal the
Persona instead-making a nearly foolproof disguise.

However, the Solar must reinforce this persona through their actions
during the scene—including being influenced by their false Intimacies.
Slips in the persona, as well as contradictory facts of the past that
cannot be changed being revealed (such a records indicating there is no
person with this name), may crack the person and cause it to fall apart
on a successful roll against the Solar’s Resolve. Once done, the person
cannot be re-entered for the remainder of the day.

### Memory-Reweaving Discipline

**Type:** Simple; Day  
**Cost:** 2a

With absolute certainty, the Solar rejects a known reality of the target
and replaces it with their own.

Any with (Essence) less than the Solar’s will not question the new
stated reality—they will believe that there is a new guard rotation
scheduled, or that the Solar is bringing prisoners into a cell, or that
an extra invitation was indeed sent to the Solar.

Against others, the Solar may make a social roll against Resolve with an
extra (Essence) dice on their efforts to convince them.

The Storyteller may grant targets extra resistance based on the
outlandishness or improbability of the narrative spoken: +2 if the story
is certainly false, +4 if running counter to all known facts of the
world.

### Soul-Snaring Contract

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** 3a

Using byzantine words, endless caveats, and simple persuasive will, the
Solar can manage to bind a target to a completely unfair contract,
ranging from selling sand to desert dwellers, to letting a man walk free
for a promise of a bond.

So long as the Solar upholds their end of the bargain, the target will
remain under the contract for at least a Month.

Any target with (Essence) less than the Solar’s does not get to resist
this effect. Against others, the Solar must successfully convince the
target to sign the contract, which is a “Perform Serious Task” action.

###  Taboo-Inflicting Diatribe

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** 2a

The Solar may dictate a specific, simple law or ideal into an
organization that they are occupy a role of high leadership or respected
association. “Do not steal from company coffers” or “express perfect
candor with clients” are examples of such laws. (“Do not steal” would be
too generic.)

This law becomes sacrosanct to the organization, and shortly a core
ideal. While there will certainly be individuals in the organization who
break this law, they become exceedingly rare.

This charm may uphold up to (Essence) different Laws. Stopping the charm
does not necessarily remove the core tenet, if it has found root in the
organization.

### Twisted Meaning

**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Cost:** 2a

With but a few well placed words, the Solar can turn the words of their
enemies against themselves.

On a successful Social roll against a target’s Resolve, the Solar
chooses a particular intimacy, topic of discussion, or idea the target
espouses, and then poisons it with the Solar’s own words.

For the remainder of the scene anytime the target speaks, acts, or
otherwise tries to communicate the poisoned concept, it will always be
expressed or interpreted as the Solar dictated: such as true belief
becoming mocking disdain.

### Venomous Rumors Technique

**Type:** Simple; Day  
**Cost:** 3a

With a firm, knowing word, invent a lie about a topic, person, or group,
rolling (Cunning + Subterfuge). The lie is then set free among the
populous, and any with a Resolve less than the number of Successes
automatically believes this rumor and spreads it to those they know.

This vicious rumor will quickly spread to an entire city, where it will
remain in the public’s consciousness for at least a day, often longer.

### Wise-Eyed Courtier Method

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** 2m

On entering the room, the Lawgiver may make a Read Intentions action
against all in the room. Roll one (Insight + Awareness) roll. Any in the
room with a Guile less than the roll is subject to their intentions
being read.

The Storyteller should surmise many of the attitudes and postures of the
characters in the room, but allow the Player to ask a question of one or
two important characters.

<div class="power_category">Capstone</div>

### <span class="smallcaps">Knowing the Soul’s Price</span>

**Type:** Simple  
**Cost:** 4a

With but a glance, the Solar pierces the soul of a person, analyzing,
dissecting, and appraising it. They will be able to reveal even the most
hidden and innermost secrets and desires.

On perceiving a target, you may discover their most useful secret or
desire. Additionally, roll Subterfuge vs. Resolve. On success, you gain
knowledge to what lengths the character will go to either keep their
secret, or fulfill the desire, and gain a hunch on where to get started
on such a task.

### <span class="smallcaps">Cup Boils Over</span>

**Type:** Simple; Week  
**Cost:** 4m

In a firey, rambunctious oration, missive, or even performance, the
Solar shatters the morality of an organization, group of people, or
specific individual with such force that all around them cannot help but
feel disgust and outrage at the target—often leading to riots at the
very least.

All who observe the Solar in their fiery passion must make a Integrity
Roll vs. the Solar’s Essence. If they fail, they become incited against
the specific ideas the Player dictates. For the remainder of the week,
they will take active action to suppress the heretical idea, and any who
agree with it. Only the Solar themselves may calm down the fury of the
riot they will inevitably produce.

Written or otherwise recorded reproductions of this diatribe will begin
to lose effectiveness, decreasing the difficulty of the roll by 1 for
each time Scale. As well, creatures without emotion or feelings are
immune to this charm.

Charms

Cecelyne
--------

### Impending Doom

**Cost:** 2m  
**Type:** Free Action; Scene  
**Mins:** Cecelyne 1

The Infernal may make an **Influence Emotion** action without being the
source of the Influence. The target will ascribe this emotion to the
closest thing that they can rationalize. If Panic were to be placed into
them, they might become convinced that their ally is about to betray
them.

### Induced Paranoia

**Cost:** 5m  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Cecelyne 2

The Infernal spikes their words with seeds of doubt, paranoia, and fear,
and then impales it into the mind of a target.

Roll (Charisma + Cecelyne) against the Target’s Resolve. On a success,
select a particular subject or concept that is to be barred. The Target
gains an immediate Intimacy of Secrecy towards this concept and will
attempt nearly anything to not talk about it, no matter how banal or
benign the concept actually is.

Often, the Infernal may use this false Intimacy to leverage out actual
secrets and information the Target may know.

### Inopportune Desire

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Cecelyne 3

The Infernal leverages a target’s Intimacy, and rolls (Insight +
Cecelyne) against the target’s Resolve. If successful, the target will
express this Intimacy in an uncontrolled, expressive manner—either
immediately, or with a specific trigger the Infernal states.

### Knowing the Desolate Heart

**Cost:** 5m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Cecelyne 4

The Infernal may make a **Discover Intimacy** action against a target to
find out the target’s current, most pressing Desire that they cannot
currently achieve. Unlike most Discover Intimacy rolls, the target does
not need to be actively displaying any signs of this current Desire.

### Conflicting Desire

**Cost:** 6m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Cecelyne 4

The Infernal leverages an Intimacy of a character, rolling (Insight +
Cecelyne) vs the target’s Resolve. If successful, they force the
character to simultaneously take an equal and opposite Intimacy for the
remainder of the scene. The target will attempt to rationalize this new
Intimacy as best they can—if they are one who reveres the Immaculate
Order, they might rationalize that their new hate for the Order is
specifically about its high devotion cost in their lives, for example.

### The Curse of Truth

**Cost:** 8m  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Cecelyne 4

On a successful (Insight + Composure) roll against the target’s Guile,
they become cursed and unable to utter anything but the truth for the
remainder of the scene.

### As You Wish

**Cost:** 10m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Cecelyne 5

Upon observing a genuine, unambiguous desire or wish, the Infernal may
intercede as a benefactor—at a price. The character will gain what they
desire, but the Infernal will collect a favor in return. The favor does
not need to be specified at this time.

In the moment this Charm is activated, the character and the Infernal
become joined through the mind’s eyes, and all illusions and influences
of reality fall to the side. Full understanding of the arrangement is
immediately understood, as is the very real doom that would befall them
if they refused to complete the favor. The character is given a choice
to accept or reject the deal. On their decision, the inner eye fades,
and all that remains is the knowledge of their decision.

The granted wish may take the form of a dot rating of an Attribute,
Ability, or Merit that is either mundane or within the purview of the
Infernal and the Endless Desert. Wealth, mortal followers, spies, even
mutation of the sand creatures may be granted—but something like the
blessing of a Yu-Shan god cannot.

When granting the wish, the Infernal may choose to be as direct and
obvious as they want—ranging from a gradual change over the scene with
no discernible source, to a blazing fire of green anima.

When the Infernal comes to collect the favor, the target will instantly
know they must perform it or experience the Dooms of the Endless Desert.
The Infernal cannot command the target to do anything that is literally
impossible for the target to do, and the target cannot be bound to the
task for more than one month.

A character cannot be the beneficiary of this charm more than once a
year. The Infernal cannot target themselves with this charm.

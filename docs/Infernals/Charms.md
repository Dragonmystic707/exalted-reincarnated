Cecelyne Charms
===============

Lesser Charms
-------------

### 

### Impending Doom

**Cost:** 2m; **Mins:** Cecelyne 1  
**Type:** Secondary Action  
**Duration:** One Scene

The Infernal may make a **Influence Emotion** action without being the
source of the Influence. The target will ascribe this emotion to the
closest thing that they can rationalize. If Panic were to be placed into
them, they might become convinced that their ally is about to betray
them.

### Induced Paranoia

**Cost:** 5m (committed); **Mins:** Cecelyne 2  
**Type:** Simple  
**Duration:** One Scene

The Infernal spikes their words with seeds of doubt, paranoia, and fear,
and then impales it into the mind of a target.

Roll (Charisma + Cecelyne) against the Target’s Resolve. On a success,
select a particular subject or concept that is to be barred. The Target
gains an immediate Intimacy of Secrecy towards this concept and will
attempt nearly anything to not talk about it, no matter how banal or
benign the concept actually is.

Often, the Infernal may use this false Intimacy to leverage out actual
secrets and information the Target may know.

### Inopportune Desire

**Cost:** 4m; **Mins:** Cecelyne 3  
**Type:** Simple  
**Duration:** Instant

The Infernal leverages a target’s Intimacy, and rolls (Insight +
Cecelyne) against the target’s Resolve. If successful, the target will
express this Intimacy in an uncontrolled, expressive manner--either
immediately, or with a specific trigger the Infernal states.

### Knowing the Desolate Heart

**Cost:** 5m; **Mins:** Cecelyne 4  
**Type:** Simple  
**Duration:** Instant

The Infernal may make a **Discover Intimacy** action against a target to
find out the target’s current, most pressing Desire that they cannot
currently achieve. Unlike most Discover Intimacy rolls, the target does
not need to be actively displaying any signs of this current Desire.

### Conflicting Desire

**Cost:** 6m; **Mins:** Cecelyne 4  
**Type:** Simple  
**Duration:** Instant

The Infernal leverages an Intimacy of a character, rolling (Insight +
Cecelyne) vs the target’s Resolve. If successful, they forcee the
character to simultaneously take an equal and opposite Intimacy for the
remainder of the scene. The target will attempt to rationalize this new
Intimacy as best they can--if they are one who reveres the Immaculate
Order, they might rationalize that their new hate for the Order is
specifically about its high devotion cost in their lives, for example.

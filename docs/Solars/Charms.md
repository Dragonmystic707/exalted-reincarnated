their next action. Targets without emotions are not effected, and the
same target cannot be hit twice in a row.

is truth. Roll (Charisma + Performance). Those with a Resolve less than
the roll become convinced of this new narrative, which lasts for at
least a Day.

The bonus Resolve from being in a Group does not apply for this charm,
but the Storyteller may grant extra Resolve based on the outlandishness
or improbability of the narrative spoken.

--------

### Tireless Burden

**Cost:** --  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Mins:** Physique 1

Through sheer force of will, the Solar may keep their body healthy,
hale, and moving past its natural limits. They may go without sleep for
an entire week at no consequences (except perhaps to their mood.)

After a week of no sleep, the Solar gains an Intimacy of “Desire to
sleep,” and must sleep normally for at least three consecutive nights to
remove this temporary Intimacy.

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Mins:** Physique 2

windows or falling five stories.

### Armored Scout’s Invigoration

**Cost:** --  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Mins:** Physique 3

### Immunity to Everything Technique

**Cost:** --  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Mins:** Physique 4

survived—they never need worry about suffering ill effects from it
again.

Politics
--------

### Deft Official’s Way

**Cost:** 5m  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Politics 1

After observing a group or organization in motion, the Solar may easily
pick out who would be receptive to a certain activity, such as
socializing, intimidation, or bribery.

### Woe Capturing Web

**Cost:** --  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Mins:** Politics 2

The Solar may monitor up to (Essence) different political circles,
organizations, or groups. They will be become immediately aware of any
large-scale actions to disrupt, curse, or otherwise hinder the group in
their main goal. They will understand the basic nature of the disruption
and epicenter, but no more than that.

The choice of selected targets may be altered between Stories.

### Semantic Argument Technique

**Cost:** 5m  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Politics 3

The Solars are known as Lawmaker, and such knowledge is intrinsic to
their very nature. During arguments involving law, procedure, or other
methodology, they gain +2 dice.

Once per Story the Solar may Introduce a Fact by revealing an arcane or
forgotten law for free. They may repeat this in a Story by spending
Strife Points as normal.

##########  Greater Charms

### Taboo-Inflicting Diatribe

**Cost:** 8m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Politics 4

The Solar may dictate a specific, simple law or ideal into an
organization that they are occupy a role of high leadership or respected
association. “Do not steal from company coffers” or “express perfect
candor with clients” are examples of such laws. (“Do not steal” would be
too generic.)

This law becomes sacrosanct to the organization, and shortly a core
ideal. While there will certainly be individuals in the organization who
break this law, they become exceedingly rare.

This charm may uphold up to (Essence) different Laws. Stopping the charm
does not necessarily remove the core tenet, if it has found root in the
organization.

### Soul-Snaring Contract

**Cost:** 10m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Politics 5

Using byzantine words, endless caveats, and simple persuasive will, the
Solar can manage to bind a target to a completely unfair contract,
ranging from selling sand to desert dwellers, to letting a man walk free
for a promise of a bond.

So long as the Solar upholds their (meager) end of the bargain, the
target will remain under the contract for at least a Month.

Any target with (Essence) less than the Solar’s does not get to resist
this effect. Against others, the Solar must successfully convince the
target to sign the contract, which is a “Perform Serious Task” action.

Socialize
---------

### Mastery of Small Manners

**Cost:** 5m  
**Type:** Reflexive; Scene  
**Mins:** Socialize 1

The Solar may quickly understand and emulate local mannerisms and
customs, eliminating any negative penalties suffered to social
interactions solely from being an outsider.

### Night Passes Over

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Mins:** Socialize 1

or an influenced Emotion.

### Taboo Crossing Method

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Reflexive  
**Mins:** Socialize 2

While distasteful, certain words must be spoken—or at least that is what
the Solar’s presence dictates. They do not suffer blow-back from merely
mentioning or discussing a topic no matter how taboo the topic may be.

### Wise Counsel

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Simple; Day  
**Mins:** Socialize 3

Advise up to (Essence) characters on a specific Socialize action, such
as specific social etiquette, methodologies to charm, or ways to speak
around a subject successfully. For the remainder of the day, the target
characters may use the Solar’s Socialize score in place of their own
whenever performing that action.

##########  Greater Charms

### Wise-Eyed Courtier Method

**Cost:** 8m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Socialize 4

On entering the room, the Lawgiver may make a Read Intentions action
against all in the room. Roll one (Insight + Awareness) roll. Any in the
room with a Guile less than the roll is subject to their intentions
being read.

The Storyteller should surmise many of the attitudes and postures of the
characters in the room, but allow the Player to ask a question of one or
two important characters.

### Asp Bites its Tail

**Cost:** 8m  
**Type:** Reflexive  
**Mins:** Socialize 5

Disparaging the Lawgiver, their name, or their Intimacies is foolish at
best. Whenever the Solar witnesses such an event, they may speak subtle
words to all those who listen and making the accuser seem the fool.

Roll (Cunning + Socialize) with (Essence) extra dice. If there are more
successes than the aggressor’s roll, the result of the intended action
turns upon the aggressor instead. If they were trying to incriminate the
Solar, they instead become incriminated.

This Charm automatically succeeds against targets with an Essence lower
than the Solar’s.

Stealth
-------

### Statue Spirit Stillness

**Cost:** 2m  
**Type:** Reflexive  
**Mins:** Stealth 1

The Solar may remain as completely stationary as long as necessary. They
show no outward signs of movement, not even breathing.

### Flawlessly Impenetrable Disguise

**Cost:** 5m  
**Type:** Simple; Day  
**Mins:** Stealth 3

Through clever trickery, the Solar manages to craft a disguise that
appears to break physical limitations, such as appearing shorter,
gaining extreme mutations such as functional extra pairs of arms, or
gain a voice that could not come from their body.

While impressive and fooling to all inspection—even detailed—it is still
just well-crafted trickery.

### Guardian Fog Approach

**Cost:** 5m  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Stealth 3

Touch up to (Essence) companions, sharing your attempts at Stealth with
them.

### Sound and Scent Banishing Attitude

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Reflexive; Scene  
**Mins:** Stealth 3

sense, completely eliminating it from the equation. Their footsteps may
become silent, or their scent hidden from tracking dogs.

##########  Greater Charms

### Sunlight Bleeding Away

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Stealth 4

Take a Stealth Maneuver action vs. a Target’s (Wits + Awareness). On
success, you disappear from their sight and become unseen and an invalid
Target by them until your next Action.

Multiple targets may be chosen at the same time, but doing so causes a
(-2) penalty on the Maneuver.

### Perfect Mirror

**Cost:** 10m  
**Type:** Simple; Week  
**Mins:** Stealth 5

Choose a target that the Solar has studied for at least a day, and then
become a perfect replica. All mannerisms and characteristics of the
target are replicated, and a surface level of knowledge and abilities
the target knows—enough to fool all but the most intimate of
acquaintances.

Even supernatural effects—such as a Anima flare, is emulated with
Essence-based illusions.

Subterfuge
----------

### Spurious Ownership

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Subterfuge 1

With the force of certainty and their unconsciously regal presence,
whatever the Solar speaks claims ownership of is instinctively believed.

With a successful Deception Roll above the target’s Guile, the target
will believe that a claimed object, structure, or even specific idea
belongs to the Solar for the remainder of the scene. This belief may
remain unless directly challenged.

If they have knowledge or direct evidence to the contrary, they instead
gain a temporary Intimacy of doubt towards their own known evidence, but
remain convinced of its true ownership.

### Preying on Uncertainty Approach

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Subterfuge 2

Through statements that deny questioning, the Solar denies the known
reality of a target, and places the stated one in instead. An unexpected
guard rotation was scheduled, an extra invitation was sent out, or the
passing glimpse of a blank paperwork certainly contained the correct
seals.

Mundane mortals will not question this uncertainty, requiring no roll to
succeed. Against other creatures, the Solar gains (Essence) dice on
their Deception roll.

##########  Greater Charms

### Twisted Meaning

**Cost:** 8m  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Subterfuge 4

With but a few well placed words, the Solar can turn the words of their
enemies against themselves.

On a successful Deception roll against a target’s Guile, the Solar
chooses a particular intimacy, topic of discussion, or idea the target
espouses, and then poisons it with the Solar’s own words.

For the remainder of the scene anytime the target speaks, acts, or
otherwise tries to communicate the poisoned concept, it will always be
expressed or interpreted as the Solar dictated: such as true belief
becoming mocking disdain.

### Master Plan Meditation

**Cost: --**  
**Type:** Reflexive  
**Mins:** Subterfuge 5

Once per story, the Player may declare their character predicted and
accordingly planned for a certain event, and have somehow twisted it to
their own benefit. Evidence provided turns out to be a planted fake;
eyewitnesses have already been successfully bribed.

This charm represents the Solar’s mastermind-level planning and
cunning—essentially revealing hidden information to the Players
themselves. As such, it can not actually change anything that has been
firmly established, but it can complicate or muddy the veracity of those
“facts.”

This charm may be used additionally in a story by spending a Strife
Point.

### Venomous Rumors Technique

**Cost:** 10m  
**Type:** Simple; Day  
**Mins:** Subterfuge 5

With a firm, knowing word, invent a lie about a topic, person, or group,
rolling (Cunning + Subterfuge). The lie is then set free among the
populous, and any with a Guile less than the number of Successes
automatically believes this rumor and spreads it to those they know.

This vicious rumor will quickly spread to an entire city, where it will
remain in the public’s consciousness for at least a day, often longer.

Thrown
------

### Flying Steel Ruse

**Cost:** 2m  
**Type:** Supplemental

target for a round.

### Observer-Deceiving Attack

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Thrown 3

Through misdirection and potential ricochets, conceal that the Solar was
the origin of a Thrown Attack. Characters must exceed a (Wits +
Awareness) roll against the number of successes of the attack.

### Falling Icicle Strike

**Cost:** 6m  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Thrown 4

During a successful Ambush round against the targets, the Solar strikes
with a killing flow of Essence. During the ambush action, Impulse gained
from a Maneuver and damage done with a Decisive Attack is doubled.

**Cost:** 5m  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Thrown 4

The Solar’s weapon careens through the air, striking target after
target.

The Solar may target up to (Essence) enemies with their Maneuver,

**Mins:** Thrown 5

Gathering anima into a burning and crackling aura, their weapon is
infused with Soulfire and is hurled at their enemy.

On a Decisive Attack, Gain (+Essence) successes on both the Accuracy and
damage rolls. If the target is a Creature of Darkness, deal an
additional (+Essence) damage.

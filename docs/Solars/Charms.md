### Inescapable Judgment

**Cost:** 2m  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** (Ranged Ability) 1

Archery
-------

### Phantom Arrow Technique

**Cost:** 1m  
**Type:** Supplemental

this dissolves, leaving no evidence behind.

### Spirit Piercing Technique

**Cost:** 2m  
**Type:** Supplemental (Attack)  
**Mins**: Archery 3

The Solar infuses their arrow with their golden anima and lets it loose
in a perfect arch, streaming with concentrated Soulfire. Spirits such as
ghosts, elementals, and gods can be pierced by these arrows—negating
their (Immaterial) defense.

Creatures of Darkness suffer an additional (+Essence) damage from this
attack.

### Splitting the Arrow

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Archery 4

The Exalt strikes with unerring accuracy and lethality, finding the

### Solar Spike

**Cost:** 5m, 2i  
**Type:** Supplemental (Flurry)  
**Mins**: Archery 4

### The Mark of Judgment

**Cost:** 8m, 3i  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins**: Archery 4

The Solar Archer ignores all Partial Defenses against the target, and
gains +1 automatic success on Accuracy Rolls.

Alternatively a specific location may be marked (no larger than 6 meters
in diameter), allowing the Solar to freely and reflexively attack any
who enter the location. This does not grant the Partial Defense removal
nor automatic success.

### Whispered Prayers of Retribution

**Cost:** 5m, 3i  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins**: Archery 5

Wrapping all of the emotions, horrors, and pain the Solar has seen into
their arrow, they pierce it into their target and force them to
experience it all in a flashing moment.

On a successful Archery Attack Maneuver or Strike, the target suffers
through visions and the emotions imparted on them, causing them to lose
their next action. Targets without emotions are not effected, and the
same target cannot be hit twice in a row.

This may be used outside of combat. As well, the Player can choose to do
no physical damage with this attack—as they may form the projectile from
their anima and emotion.

### Searing Sunfire Interdiction

**Cost:** 10m, 4i  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins**: Archery 5

The Solar focuses all their Wrath into a single shot, and selects a
target location—such as where a person is standing. They then launch a
streaming arrow of light into the air.

At the start of the next Round, the arrow crashes down at the targeted
location, dealing \[Archery + (Essence) x2\] damage to all within Short
Range of the target location.

For the remainder of the scene, the affected area becomes bathed in
Soulfire Environmental Damage. (Essence) per Round.

Impulse on their Accuracy, If the attacker only had 2 Impulse, they
automatically miss.

### Foe-Vaulting Method

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Supplemental (Disengage)  
**Mins:** Athletics 3

Swift as the wind, the Solar may vault across, above, or around an enemy
with blurring speed.

pursuer’s Evasion, instead of the normal disengage roll. (If there are
multiple enemies, choose the target with the highest Evasion.)

(Threshold Successes) Impulse. If they do not have enough Impulse, the
target become Stunned.

### Unsurpassed Senses Discipline

**Cost: --**  
**Type:** Permanent

beyond that of mortal limits. Battlefields are seen in perfect clarity,
the subtle changes of the winds, and the divine differences of different
variety of herbs play across taste.

shut it out as normal—they do not become more susceptible to pain

<div class="greater_charm">Greater Charms</div>

### Marvelous Machinery

**Cost:** 8m  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Craft 4

The Solar imbues a statue, complex machinery, or even inert ancient
working with their very Essence—so long as it is not currently bound to
a hostile entity. For the Scene the Solar may control this imbued object
as though it were an extension of their body.

Hostile entities may attempt to wrest control from the object by
performing a contested Craft Roll.

Deception
---------

### Spurious Ownership

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Deception 1

With the force of certainty and their unconsciously regal presence,
whatever the Solar speaks claims ownership of is instinctively believed.

With a successful Deception Roll above the target’s Guile, the target
will believe that a claimed object, structure, or even specific idea
belongs to the Solar for the remainder of the scene. This belief may
remain unless directly challenged.

If they have knowledge or direct evidence to the contrary, they instead
gain a temporary Intimacy of doubt towards their own known evidence, but
remain convinced of its true ownership.

### Preying on Uncertainty Approach

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Deception 2

Through statements that deny questioning, the Solar denies the known
reality of a target, and places the stated one in instead. An unexpected
guard rotation was scheduled, an extra invitation was sent out, or the
passing glimpse of a blank paperwork certainly contained the correct
seals.

Mundane mortals will not question this uncertainty, requiring no roll to
succeed. Against other creatures, the Solar gains (Essence) dice on
their Deception roll.

Integrity
---------

Leadership
----------

<div class="greater_charm">Greater Charms</div>

### Commanding Words

**Cost:** 6m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Leadership 4

Drawing from their divine rule, a Solar makes a quick command, from
which all snap to attention and must obey.

The Solar targets a Mortal, or a Yu-Shan spirit of Essence less than the
Solar. So long as they issue a simple command that may be accomplished
by an individual or a group in the scene, the target must obey. If the
target is some other entity, the Solar must roll Composure + Leadership
vs. their Resolve.

If the task would run counter their intimacies, or the task is
considered unacceptable influence, this charm automatically fails.

Stealth
-------

### 

<div class="greater_charm">Greater Charms</div>

### Sunlight Bleeding Away

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Stealth 4.

Take a Stealth Maneuver action vs. a Target’s (Wits + Awareness). On
success, you disappear from their sight and become unseen and an invalid
Target by them until your next Action.

Multiple targets may be chosen at the same time, but doing so causes a
(-2) penalty on the Maneuver.

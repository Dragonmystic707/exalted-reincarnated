Charms
======

Global Charms
-------------

### Inescapable Judgment

**Cost:** 2m  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** (Ranged Ability) 1

With perfect control, the Solar lets loose a ranged attack that follows
a perfect arc, angle, or even a series of ricochets to reach its target,
diminishing the target’s Cover. Those in Full Cover only gain Partial
Defense, while those in any less find their cover becoming meaningless.

Archery
-------

### Phantom Arrow Technique

**Cost:** 1m  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins**: Archery 1

Instead of ammunition, the Solar may use their very anima. Once struck,
this dissolves, leaving no evidence behind.

### Spirit Piercing Technique

**Cost:** 2m  
**Type:** Supplemental (Attack)  
**Mins**: Archery 3

The Solar infuses their arrow with their golden anima and lets it loose
in a perfect arch, streaming with concentrated Soulfire. Spirits such as
ghosts, elementals, and gods can be pierced by these arrows—negating
their (Immaterial) defense.

Creatures of Darkness suffer an additional (+Essence) damage from this
attack.

### Splitting the Arrow

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Archery 4

The Exalt strikes with unerring accuracy and lethality, finding the
smallest chink of armor and exploiting it. The Archery action targets
Evasion, instead of DV.

**Upgrade**: At Essence 4, this charm deals an extra +2 damage.

### Solar Spike

**Cost:** 5m, 2i  
**Type:** Supplemental (Flurry)  
**Mins**: Archery 4

Conjuring the deepest Intimacy, the Solar lashes out with a spike of
Soulfire, launching a Flurry Attack that deals a +(2) damage each, up to
(Essence) targets

The spike jumps from target to target like lightning, and may continue
past the Solar’s typically range boundary so long as each target is
within Short Range of the last.

<div class="greater_charm">Greater Charms</div>

### The Mark of Judgment

**Cost:** 8m, 3i  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins**: Archery 4

The Solar marks a specific target, burning it perfectly into their mind.
The Solar Archer ignores all Partial Defenses against the target, and
gains +1 automatic success on Accuracy Rolls.

Alternatively a specific location may be marked (no larger than 6 meters
in diameter), allowing the Solar to freely and reflexively attack any
who enter the location. This does not grant the Partial Defense removal
nor automatic success.

### Whispered Prayers of Retribution

**Cost:** 5m, 3i  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins**: Archery 5

Wrapping all of the emotions, horrors, and pain the Solar has seen into
their arrow, they pierce it into their target and force them to
experience it all in a flashing moment.

On a successful Archery Attack Maneuver or Strike, the target suffers
through visions and the emotions imparted on them, causing them to lose
their next action. Targets without emotions are not effected, and the
same target cannot be hit twice in a row.

This may be used outside of combat. As well, the Player can choose to do
no physical damage with this attack—as they may form the projectile from
their anima and emotion.

### Searing Sunfire Interdiction

**Cost:** 10m, 4i  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins**: Archery 5

The Solar focuses all their Wrath into a single shot, and selects a
target location—such as where a person is standing. They then launch a
streaming arrow of light into the air.

At the start of the next Round, the arrow crashes down at the targeted
location, dealing \[Archery + (Essence) x2\] damage to all within Short
Range of the target location.

For the remainder of the scene, the affected area becomes bathed in
Soulfire Environmental Damage. (Essence) per Round.

**Type:** Reflexive  
**Mins:** Athletics 3

The Solar flares a glimpse of their anima at just the right moment,
temporarily blinding their opponent as they attack them.

When defending with Evasion, the Solar will force the attacker to lose 2
Impulse on their Accuracy, If the attacker only had 2 Impulse, they
automatically miss.

### Foe-Vaulting Method

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Supplemental (Disengage)  
**Mins:** Athletics 3

Swift as the wind, the Solar may vault across, above, or around an enemy
with blurring speed.

The character proactively rolls (Dex + Athletics) against their
pursuer’s Evasion, instead of the normal disengage roll. (If there are
multiple enemies, choose the target with the highest Evasion.)

On Success, disengage to Short Range, and force the target to lose
(Threshold Successes) Impulse. If they do not have enough Impulse, the
target become Stunned.

### Seven Shadows Evasion

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Reflexive  
**Mins:** Athletics 4

The Solar is as swift as the shadows they cast, and may Increase their
Evasion against an attack by (Essence).

<div class="greater_charm">Greater Charms</div>

### Sunlight’s Advance

**Cost:** --**  
Type:** Permanent  
**Mins:** Athletics 4

All of The Solar’s movement is doubled—rolls depending on speed add an
additional (Athletics) dice. Leaps and bounds are also doubled.

In combat, Dashes may be taken at no penalty.

### Eagle-Wing Style

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Supplemental; Scene  
**Mins:** Athletics 5

**Type:** Supplemental (Move)  
**Mins:** Athletics 5

---------

### Inquisitor’s Unfailing Notice

**Cost: --**  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Mins:** Awareness 1

The Solar is instinctively and subconsciously aware of any actions of
thievery or Stealth performed by those in their presence who are below

disclosed, simply the fact that it is happening.

### Genius Palate Summation

**Cost:** 2m  
**Type: Simple**  
**Mins:** Awareness 3

The emotions and intentions of an individual bleed through to their
craftsmanship. Upon eating, imbibing, or otherwise interacting with food

Action against them.

### Unsurpassed Sense Discipline

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Reflexive  
**Mins:** Awareness 3

The Solar reduces Awareness disadvantages due to distance by up to
(Essence) dice. This also opens up Awareness checks up to twice the
normal distance--they can clearly hear or see across a field.

### Living Pulse Perception

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Awareness 4

By focusing all their senses into a single point, the Solar can gather a
trace of all living, breathing, and/or moving creatures.

This allows a roll against all hidden creatures that breathe, live, or
are currently in motion in the current scene, and eliminates up to
(Essence) penalties that would be applied against the roll.

### Irresistible Questioning Technique

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Awareness 4

The Solar’s unquestioning gaze will make even the most unwilling talk.

Guile. If successful, the target *must* answer and speak the truth to
that particular question.

<div class="greater_charm">Greater Charms</div>

### Unsurpassed Senses Discipline

**Cost: --**  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Mins:** Awareness 4

All of the senses of the Solar become perfected; they become enhanced
beyond that of mortal limits. Battlefields are seen in perfect clarity,
the subtle changes of the winds, and the divine differences of different
variety of herbs play across taste.

This enhanced sense behaves naturally to the Solar, and they are able to
shut it out as normal—they do not become more susceptible to pain
because their ability to feel has become more broad, for example.

### Eye of the Unconquered Sun

**Cost:** 10m  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Awareness 5

For a Moment, the Caste Mark of the Solar flares up for all to see and
becomes a focal lens for the Inner eye, revealing all to the Lawgiver.

For that brief moment, all characters in the scene can be sensed, giving
a snapshot of their current position, and movement.

As well, roll a (Wits + Awareness). All characters in the scene with
(Essence) less or equal to the roll are valid targets for any future
perception during the scene, regardless of obstacles such as hiding
behind walls.

### Enlightened Touch Insight

**Cost:** 6m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Awareness 5

By touching or analyzing an object for a moment, the Solar can surmise

**Type:** Simple

double its normal Resource value.

### Spiritual Armaments

**Cost:** 6m  
**Type:** Simple; (Essence) Days  
**Mins:** Craft 2

By reaching deep into their psyche, the Solar can manifest a
fully-formed armament of their choice into the world—a coalesced form of

<div class="greater_charm">Greater Charms</div>

### Marvelous Machinery

**Cost:** 8m  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Craft 4

The Solar imbues a statue, complex machinery, or even inert ancient
working with their very Essence—so long as it is not currently bound to
a hostile entity. For the Scene the Solar may control this imbued object
as though it were an extension of their body.

Hostile entities may attempt to wrest control from the object by
performing a contested Craft Roll.

Deception
---------

### Spurious Ownership

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Deception 1

With the force of certainty and their unconsciously regal presence,
whatever the Solar speaks claims ownership of is instinctively believed.

With a successful Deception Roll above the target’s Guile, the target
will believe that a claimed object, structure, or even specific idea
belongs to the Solar for the remainder of the scene. This belief may
remain unless directly challenged.

If they have knowledge or direct evidence to the contrary, they instead
gain a temporary Intimacy of doubt towards their own known evidence, but
remain convinced of its true ownership.

### Preying on Uncertainty Approach

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Deception 2

Through statements that deny questioning, the Solar denies the known
reality of a target, and places the stated one in instead. An unexpected
guard rotation was scheduled, an extra invitation was sent out, or the
passing glimpse of a blank paperwork certainly contained the correct
seals.

Mundane mortals will not question this uncertainty, requiring no roll to
succeed. Against other creatures, the Solar gains (Essence) dice on
their Deception roll.

<div class="greater_charm">Greater Charms</div>

### Twisted Meaning

**Cost:** 8m  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Deception 4

With but a few well placed words, the Solar can turn the words of their
enemies against themselves.

On a successful Deception roll against a target’s Guile, the Solar
chooses a particular intimacy, topic of discussion, or idea the target
espouses, and then poisons it with the Solar’s own words.

For the remainder of the scene anytime the target speaks, acts, or
otherwise tries to communicate the poisoned concept, it will always be
expressed or interpreted as the Solar dictated: such as true belief
becoming mocking disdain.

### Master Plan Meditation

**Cost: --**  
**Type:** Reflexive  
**Mins:** Deception 5

Once per story, the Player may declare their character predicted and
accordingly planned for a certain event, and have somehow twisted it to
their own benefit. Evidence provided turns out to be a planted fake;
eyewitnesses have already been successfully bribed.

This charm represents the Solar’s mastermind-level planning and
cunning—essentially revealing hidden information to the Players
themselves. As such, it can not actually change anything that has been
firmly established, but it can complicate or muddy the veracity of those
“facts.”

This charm may be used additionally in a story by spending a Strife
Point.

Integrity
---------

### Certainty of Form

**Cost:** 2m per target  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Integrity 2  
**Prerequisite:** Integrity Protection Prana

The Solar protects not only themselves, but their certainty of will
extends to others.

Grant the effects of Integrity Protection Prana for the scene to up to
(Essence) x2 targets, at a cost of 2m per target.

### Sun King Radiance

**Cost:** 1m per target  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Integrity 3

The Solar radiates their strength to others. Choose up to (Essence) x2
targets, and one of the Solar’s Intimacies. So long as the target is
acting in accordance with the Intimacy, they may use the Resolve of the
Solar instead of their own.

<div class="greater_charm">Greater Charms</div>

### Eminent Paragon Approach

**Cost:** 6m  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Integrity 4

When acting with direct purpose and in conjunction with one of their
Intimacies, the Solar’s motions become unimpeded for the Scene. Any who
has a Resolve less than that the Solar’s Essence will instinctively part
in silence, and will always allow the Solar to speak first.

### Accord of the Unbreakable Spirit

**Cost:** 8m  
**Type:** Simple; Week  
**Mins:** Integrity 5

Choose one of your Intimacies, and spend an hour leading a group of up
to 10 people in meditation, prayer, or other such mind-cleansing
activities. For the remainder of the week, the group will consider any
Influence against the chosen Intimacy to be Unacceptable Influence.

Only one Intimacy may be reinforced at a time through this method.

### Righteous Lion Defense

**Cost: --**  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Mins:** Integrity 5

The Exalt becomes one with their own Intimacies, and instinctively knows
when people are attempting to lead the Solar to take action against
them, no matter how sweet their words or naive their intention may be.

Additionally, if the Solar ever finds themselves in an impossible
situation where they would have to betray one of their Intimacies, they
may spend a Strife Point, and they will find a new, seemingly impossible
path that they will be able to successfully pursue.

Leadership
----------

### Peril-Demanding Haste

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Leadership 1

On successfully convincing a target to perform an Inconvenient task, the
Solar immediately Instills an emotion of “impending peril.” The target
will complete the task in half of the normal time, if at all physically
possible.

### Empowering Shout

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Leadership 2

Grant +2 to a target character’s Ability score (or +1 for a static
Value). This lasts for a Round.

### Underling-Promoting Touch

**Cost:** 6m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Leadership 3

The Solar may uplifts a servant to act in their stead, designating their
role as a ruler, guide, or other form of leadership to a group of
people. While the target is acting in given role, and in accordance with
the Solar’s Intimacies, all who gaze on them will instinctively know
they work on behalf of the Solar.

In addition, the target may use the Leadership, Guile, and/or Resolve of
the Solar in place of their own while operating in their given capacity.

The Solar may only designate one target at a time for this effect. They
may choose to rescind their blessing, or perform a 10 Res. Project to
make this effect permanent, either of which would allow them to bless a
new target.

### Enemy-Castigating Solar Judgment

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Leadership 3

Supplement a social action against a Creature of Darkness with an
additional +3 dice.

<div class="greater_charm">Greater Charms</div>

### Majestic Radiant Presence

**Cost:** 6m  
**Type:** Reflexive  
**Mins:** Leadership 4

None may speak before the Lawgiver’s voice has been heard.

Interrupt a target before or during a social action, such as speaking,
performing, or using Social Influence. The Solar may immediately take
their own social action, forcing the target to wait until the Solar is
done.

Any who observes this interruption with a Guile less than the Solar’s
Essence will develop a temporary negative Intimacy of “disdain” towards
the target—including the target themselves.

### Fear-Banishing Aura

**Cost:** 6m  
**Type:** Reflexive; Scene  
**Mins:** Leadership 4

Allies need only look to the Solar to steady their nerves and keep their
wits together.

Immediately banish fear, panic, and other similar emotions from all
allies within Medium Range of the Solar, and force any future attempts
to fail for the remainder of the scene.

This Charm does not protect against the Dawn Caste’s Strife.

### Commanding Words

**Cost:** 6m  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Leadership 5

Drawing from their divine rule, a Solar makes a quick command, from
which all snap to attention and must obey.

The Solar targets a Mortal, or a Yu-Shan spirit of Essence less than the
Solar. Any inconvenient task the Solar commands will be performed to the
best of their abilities, without question nor needed roll.

If the target is some other entity, the Solar must succeed on a
(Composure + Leadership) vs. Resolve roll for this to take effect.

If a given task would run counter their intimacies, or the task is
otherwise considered unacceptable influence, this charm automatically
fails and the target is broken from the Solar’s influence.

Lore
----

### Order-Affirming Blow

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Lore 2

The Solar knows the effects of the Wyld, Underworld, and other such
places that might try to forcibly change the targets.

So long as the effects have occurred within the last week, and not
deeply ingrained into the soul of the subject, the Solar may banish the
changes.

### Will-Shattering Riddle

**Cost:** 5m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Lore 2

The Solar Poses a terrible Paradox to the target, forcing them to be
involved and distracted solving it.

Roll a contested (Int. + Lore). If the target fails, they suffer from
Exhaustion to their Mental category, and lose 2 dice from any Awareness
rolls for the remainder of the scene.

Only one such forced Exhaustion may be on a target per Scene.

### Truth-Rendering Gaze

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Lore 3

Roll (Insight + Lore) against a target’s Guile. On a success, learn
insight on the nature of a creature. Much like “Read Intentions,” the
Player asks a question that the Storyteller must answer truthfully, if
cryptically.

### Harmonious Academic Methodology

**Cost:** 6m  
**Type:** Simple; Week  
**Mins:** Lore 4

Targeting a non-Player individual, organization, or other such group,
the Solar may grant their knowledge and resources. The target(s) gain +2
dice on a particular type of task that the Solar is designates.

This effect lasts for a week.

### Inspection of Flaw

**Cost: --**  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Mins:** Lore 4

usage.

### Wyld-Shaping Technique

**Cost:** 6m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Lore 5

The Solar imposes their will upon the Wyld, and it must obey.

Once a story, gain +15 Resources. As well, the Solar may create projects
in the Wyld without suffering any Opposition Modifiers from the land.

Creating Manses and other places of Power from the Wyld becomes a valid
Project.

Melee
-----

### Call the Blade

**Cost:** 1m  
**Type:** Free Action  
**Mins:** Melee 2

Return a weapon to the Solar’s hand, so long as a path exists for the
weapon to follow. This charm may also be used to banish or summon a
weapon from Elsewhere as a Free Action.

**Cost:** 5m  
**Type:** Reflexive  
**Mins:** Melee 3

Once per Session, after being attacked by an opponent in Melee range,
the Solar can immediately make a Decisive Attack against them. This does

Point.

### Edge of Morning

**Cost:** 4m, 1i  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Melee 3

### Sandstorm-Wind

**Type:** Supplemental

**Cost: --**  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Mins:** Melee 4

### Burning Mein

**Cost:** (3m) per. Endurance  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Melee 5

The Solar gains momentum as the battle mounts. So long as they can see
the battle is not fruitless, they can keep moving forward.

On damaging a foe that is not a Lesser Foe, regain Endurance at a rate
of 3m per Endurance. This cannot heal more than the total amount of
damage dealt during the attack.

Navigation
----------

### Sometimes Horses Fly

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Reflexive  
**Mins:** Navigation 2

### Sunlight Bleeding Away

success, you disappear from their sight and become unseen and an invalid
Target by them until your next Action.

Multiple targets may be chosen at the same time, but doing so causes a
(-2) penalty on the Maneuver.

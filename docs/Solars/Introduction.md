Introduction
============

Solars are the paragons of man. They turn the power of the Sun inward,
focusing and enhancing their abilities to peak power.

Solars resonate with artifacts made of **Orichalcum**, and may purchase
Evocations of those artifacts as though it was a Favored Power.

Character Creation
------------------

### Supernal

Solars gain a **Supernal** Ability, in addition to choosing Five (5)
Favored Abilities. A Supernal Ability can be chosen from any Natural
Abilities, as well as Sorcery.

A Supernal Ability is considered to be a Favored Ability for all aspects
of the game, such as for xp cost calculations. In addition, a Solar may
buy **Greater Charms and Martial Arts Techniques** that use their
Supernal Ability, even at Essence 1.

In the case of **Supernal Sorcery**, the Solar may be inducted into each
circle as though they were +2 Essence. They may enter into Sapphire
Circle at Essence 1, and Adamant Circle at Essence 3, gaining access to
their respective spells.

### Focused Anima Banner

\[\[Solars get extra bonuses while their anima banner is flaring\]\]

### Expanded Mote Pool

Solars gain an expanded Peripheral Mote pool: (Essence) + 5 additional
Motes, bringing the total to:

**Peripheral** (Essence) x3 + 20

### Defining Intimacy

A Solar *must* choose a Defining Intimacy as one of their three
intimacies.

Castes
------

### Dawn

Spending a Strife Point, the Dawn immediately instills an emotion of
Fear, Awe, Intimidation, or similar emotion into up to (Essence)
targets. This may affect targets that normally do not feel said
emotions, such as golems and zombies.

**Burning Anima:**  
Dawn Castes gain an additional 2 Impulse on Maneuvers in a Combat Scene.

*Associated Abilities:* Archery, Awareness, Brawl, Physique, Melee,
Leadership.

### Zenith

Spending a Strife Point, the Zenith’s flaring anima becomes a weapon
against all those that shirk from the Sun’s Gaze for the entire Scene.
All Creatures of Darkness who end their action within Close Range of the
Zenith immediately take 5 Damage. Any creature or being who dies in the
bathing light of the Zenith cannot be raised as a zombie or hungry
ghost.

*Associated Abilities:* Integrity, Performance, Leadership, Physique,
Navigation, Socialize

### Twilight

The Twilight’s mind brims with possibilities unseen to others. Spending
a Strife Point, the Twilight predicts a sequence of events that they,
and their companions, may take to bring about their desired result in a
scene. The Storyteller must accept this prediction as fact when crafting
the scene.

*Associated Abilities*: Awareness, Craft, Lore, Politics, Sorcery

### Night

The Night caste excels at secrecy and subtlety. By Spending a Strife
Point the Night may choose at any time during the Scene to conceal or
reveal their Anima Banner, up to Burning Level.

**Burning Anima:**  
At Bonfire Level, they may instead curl their Anima inwards to obscure
all discerning characteristics—the existence of an Exalt is undeniable,
but no possible form of perception can reveal their identity.

*Associated Abilities*: Athletics, Awareness, Deception, Navigation,
Stealth, Thrown

### Eclipse

The Eclipse is the ultimate diplomat, and can bring even hardened
enemies to the table. Once per Story and by spending a Strife Point, the
Eclipse caste may force an armistice between two (or more) parties. For
the next scene, all involved are forced to meet peacefully, and cannot
attack each other during discussions.

In addition, an Eclipse may spend a Strife Point and sanctify an Oath
willingly made by Non-Player Characters. The NPC will not be able to
break said oath.

*Associated Abilities*: Deception, Integrity, Leadership, Lore,
Politics, Socialize.

Strife Expression
-----------------

### Solar Excellency

The Solar chooses a Favored or Supernal Ability and then **doubles**
their permanent value for the remainder of the Scene. This effect also
carries over into any derived **Static Values.**

Who Becomes a Solar?
--------------------

The Unconquered Sun grants his blessing to those who have an incredible
drive, a force of personality that would change their world, regardless
of the Sun’s power. Often they already have.

The Sun does not judge the “righteousness” of the prospect’s drive or
personality, simply that they will use it. His blessing shines equally
on Just Rulers as it does Tyrants.

Great Curse
-----------

Solars are often plagued and defined by their **Ego.** Caretakers of
great power, they will see the problems and ills of the world only in
relationship to themselves.

Creatures of Darkness
---------------------

Solars have powers that are harmful to *Creatures of Darkness*. These
are any Spirits, demons, or other supernatural creatures whose bodies
and nature recoil at the sight of the sun. It is not some sort of
judgment of how good and moral the creature is, rather just a statement
of what powers sustain them.

Creatures of Darkness are any denizens of the **Underworld**, such as
ghosts, specters, and zombies. The Exaltations **Abyssals** and
**Liminals** also fall under this category.

Demons that descend from the shadowy **Ebon Dragon** are also considered
to be Creatures of Darkness.

Soulfire
--------

\[\[Describe SoulFire/Sunfire here, and how it damages Creatures of
Darkness and why. Also decide if it’s called Soulfire or Sunfire\]\]

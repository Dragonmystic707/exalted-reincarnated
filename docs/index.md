Exalted Reincaranated is a fan-made, top-to-bottom mechanics rewrite of the [**Exalted System**](http://theonyxpath.com/category/worlds/exalted/) by Onyx Path Publishing. 
While the setting is fascinating, compelling, and contains great thematics, the mechanics supporting the setting are overcomplicated, and ultimately fall short of delivering on its thematics.

The aim of this project is to provide a new system that is simplier to learn, but still provides a greate variety of customization to the player. This is, as best we can make it, an entirely new
"edition" of the game, where we take everything apart, analyze its purpose, and build anew.

**Mechanical Highlights:**

 * **Strifes:** Gained through roleplay, these points may be expended to "break the rules" of the system in a limited way, allowing the Players to directly dictate where the story is going.
 * **Charm Compaction:** The Charms (Powers) of a character are far more compact in design. 3rd Edition had far too many charms that did very little individually, while here each charm should *do* something with fewer to keep track of.
 * **Combat:** Combat has been streamlined, and focused more on the narrative structure of your character. Classical "non-combatants" have options to perform, while "Combat" characters can still star in the scene. As well, it should not take hours to finish a combat.
 * **Encounters:** A system has been created to help guide non-combat encounters, so that your courtroom scene or "Picard Speech" can have the same weight as combat.
 * **Projects:** A downtime system that lets the characters change the world at large.

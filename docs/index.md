*Upon your brow lies the mark of a God: a brand of power that sets you
apart from mortals, given in a moment of transcendent glory--regardless
of your desire for the power.*

*With it, a vast wealth of supernatural power lies at your fingertips:
tasks that you once toiled and struggled against are easily swept aside.
Tasks that you deemed impossible suddenly a very real possibility.*

*Yet this land you reside in, this Creation, is filled with dangerous
creatures, monsters, Spirits and Gods that is now your responsibility to
deal with.*

*It is for you to decide what should be protected, what should be
furthered; what is ultimately right and wrong.*

*But you are not alone. There are other Exalts that wander the world,
each with their own agenda, ideas, and morality.*

*You are Chosen, you are EXALTED.*

 Preface
=======

**Exalted**, by **Onyx Path Publishing,** is a role-playing game
blending together high-action combat, social intrigue, and epic-scale
actions from demigod heroes.

The setting is full of rich lore, intricacies, and horrors that inspire
and captivate the mind, begging to be explored by a hero of grand scale.

However, the complexity and sheer size of the rules structure makes
playing the game a daunting task, even for experienced role-players.

**Exalted Reincarnated** is a fan-made work to rebuild and recreate
Exalted from the ground up to better match its rich Lore, Setting, and
Style.

Unofficial
----------

This is Fan-Made material. It is unofficial, and makes no claims of
ownership over Onyx Path Publishing materials.

You will need the official *Exalted* books for lore, setting and
reference material. *Exalted Reincarnated* makes assumptions based off
of Third Edition, but can be played with any of the editions.

Feedback
--------

This project is constantly evolving and changing. If you find problems
or want to simply share suggestions, please do so!

*Have fun!*

Exalted Reincaranated is a fan-made, top-to-bottom mechanics rewrite of the [**Exalted System**](http://theonyxpath.com/category/worlds/exalted/) by Onyx Path Publishing.

The goal is to make a system that focuses more on Player actions, rather than system mechanics. You should not need to reference the manual so many times to play a Role-Playing Game.

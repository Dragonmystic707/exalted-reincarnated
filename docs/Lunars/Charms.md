Charms

\[\[todo: Clay-wetting Practice, Instant Changes, Hybrid Body
Rearrangement\]

 Shapeshifting
=============

Lesser Charms
-------------

### Hybrid Body Rearrangement

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Secondary Action (Scene)  
**Mins:** Shapeshifting 1

The Lunar becomes able to manifest a Boon of one of their known animal
forms by only partially shifting their body.

### Life of the Hummingbird

**Cost:** 5m  
**Type:** Primary Action (Scene)  
**Mins:** Shapeshifting 1

A form may be stolen by simply the taste of another’s blood, allowing
the Lunar to use the form for One Scene. The scene does not have to be
the same one in which the blood was taken, but cannot be more than 2
days apart.

The form taken must still adhere to what forms the Lunar could take.

The amount taken is enough to cause a sharp pain to the target--enough
to be noticed and potentially attributed to a particularly nasty scratch
or cut, but not so much that it is considered a wound or impairs the
target.

### Changing Plumage Mastery

**Cost:** 2m  
**Type:** Secondary Action (Scene)  
**Mins:** Shapeshifting 1

The Lunar may alter their known forms into different patterns and
markings that could plausibly be part of their form, ranging from colors
to patterning to even texture.

If they have Prey's Skin Disguise, they also may mimic and alter
clothing.

Accurately Mimicking a *specific* pattern is a contested roll of
(Cunning + Shapeshifting) vs. the target's (Insight + Awareness)
defense.

### Prey’s Skin Disguise

**Cost:** --; **Mins:** Shapeshifting 2  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Duration:** Permanent

The Lunar is able to take the forms of Humans and other humanoid mortals
(such as Dragon Kings and Mountain Folk).

### Emerald Grasshopper Form

**Cost:** --; **Mins:** Shapeshifting 3  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Duration:** Permanent

The Size Boon of **Miniscule** becomes available to the Lunar, allowing
them to express this boon and shapeshift into creatures this size.

### Towering Beast Form

**Cost:** --; **Mins:** Shapeshifting 3  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Duration:** Permanent

The Size Boon of **Giant** becomes available to the Lunar, allowing them
to express this boon and shapeshift into creatures this size.

### Spirit-Stealing Form

**Cost:** --; **Mins:** Shapeshifting 4  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Duration:** Permanent

The Lunar is able to take the forms of Spirits, Demons, Elementals and
other such mythical creatures, so long as the target has an Essence
Rating Equal to or less than the Lunar’s.

Greater Charms

### Constant Quicksilver Rearrangement

**Cost:** --; **Mins:** Shapeshifting 4  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Duration:** Permanent

All shapeshifting actions may be performed Instantaneously, and are
considered Reflexive instead of a Secondary Action.

### Insidious Lunar Transformation

**Cost:** 8m, 2i; **Mins:** Shapeshifting 4  
**Type:** Primary Action  
**Duration:** One Scene

By pouring their own blood (worth 2 Endurance) into a target, the Lunar
instantly alters the form of another into an animal from their Heart’s
Blood library. This effect will last until the remainder of the Scene.

If done in combat, this is a Primary Action that must be done at Close
Range.

If the target is unwilling, the Lunar must first succeed on a (Essence +
Shapeshifting) roll vs the target’s Resolve.

### Throat-Baring Hold

succeed on their grapple, they also immediately deal (Strength) damage
to the target.

Shapeshifting
-------------

### Hybrid Body Rearrangement

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Free Action (Scene)  
**Mins:** Shapeshifting 1

The Lunar becomes able to manifest a Boon of one of their known animal
forms by only partially shifting their body.

### Life of the Hummingbird

**Cost:** 5m  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Shapeshifting 1

A form may be stolen by simply the taste of an other’s blood, allowing
the Lunar to use the form for One Scene. The scene does not have to be
the same one in which the blood was taken, but cannot be more than 2
days apart.

The form taken must still adhere to what forms the Lunar could take.

The amount taken is enough to cause a sharp pain to the target—enough to
be noticed and potentially attributed to a particularly nasty scratch or
cut, but not so much that it is considered a wound or impairs the
target.

### Changing Plumage Mastery

**Cost:** 2m  
**Type:** Free Action; Scene  
**Mins:** Shapeshifting 1

The Lunar may alter their known forms into different patterns and
markings that could plausibly be part of their form, ranging from colors
to patterning to even texture.

If they have Prey’s Skin Disguise, they also may mimic and alter
clothing.

Accurately Mimicking a *specific* pattern is a contested roll of (Wits +
Shapeshifting) vs. the target’s (Insight + Awareness) defense.

### Prey’s Skin Disguise

**Cost:** --  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Mins:** Shapeshifting 2

The Lunar is able to take the forms of Humans and other humanoid mortals
(such as Dragon Kings and Mountain Folk).

### Emerald Grasshopper Form

**Cost:** --;  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Mins:** Shapeshifting 3

The Size Boon of **Minuscule** becomes available to the Lunar, allowing
them to express this boon and shapeshift into creatures this size.

### Towering Beast Form

**Cost:** --  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Mins:** Shapeshifting 3

The Size Boon of **Giant** becomes available to the Lunar, allowing them
to express this boon and shapeshift into creatures this size.

### Spirit-Stealing Form

**Cost:** --  
**Type:** Permanent

The Lunar is able to take the forms of Spirits, Demons, Elementals and
other such mythical creatures, so long as the target has an Essence
Rating Equal to or less than the Lunar’s.

### Gift of the Moon

**Cost:** --  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Mins:** Shapeshifting 5

You may now perform Projects to grant the Rank 4 [Endowment](endowment)
Merit of Shapeshifting to those with significant ties to the character.

You may grant Rank 3 to groups, which self-perpetuates without your
influence, based on a method that you decide. The maximum number of
people it can effect is limited to a Village’s population.

### Constant Quicksilver Rearrangement

**Cost:** --  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Mins:** Shapeshifting 4

All shapeshifting actions may be performed Instantaneously, without mote
cost, and are considered Reflexive instead of Free Action.

### Insidious Lunar Transformation

**Cost:** 8m, (3i)  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Shapeshifting 4

By pouring their own blood (worth 2 Endurance) into a target, the Lunar
instantly alters the form of another into an animal from their Heart’s
Blood library. This effect will last until the remainder of the Scene.

If done in combat, this action must be done in Melee Range, with 3
Impulse.

If the target is unwilling, the Lunar must first succeed on a (Essence +
Shapeshifting) roll vs the target’s Resolve.

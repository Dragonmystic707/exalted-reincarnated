============

Deadly Beastman Style
---------------------

**Shapeshifting, Physique, Brawl**

No External Armor, No External Weapons

The Deadly Beastman, on taking this form, merges their Spirit Form and
Human form into one, as though they had flared their anima to its full
level.

The Beastman grows natural weaponry, based on the natural weaponry of
their Spirit Form. While they are still considered unarmed, they may use
the statistics of Unarmed, Light, or Medium Weaponry, with an added +1
to Base Damage. The category choice should be reflective of their Spirit
Form’s natural weaponry.  
\[+3 acc, +1 Dmg; +2Acc +2 Dmg; or +1 Acc +3 Dmg\]

The Beastman gains the size of **Large** (+2 Soak, + 5 Endurance, and -2
successes on Fine Dexterity/Sneak rolls). This does not affect Lunars
who are already of size Large (or bigger).

If the Beastman’s animal form has natural armor, such as a carapace or
scales, they may gain an additional +1 Soak at the cost of -1 Evasion.

Aside from this, other mutations still follow the **Hybrid Body Rules**
(including their alteration from the Hybrid Body Rearrangement)

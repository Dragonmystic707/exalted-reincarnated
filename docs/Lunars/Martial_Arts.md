Deadly Beastman Style
---------------------

**Shapeshifting, Physique, Brawl**

No External Armor, No External Weapons

The Deadly Beastman, on taking this form, merges their Spirit Form and
Human form into one, as though they had flared their anima to its full
level.

The Beastman grows natural weaponry, based on the natural weaponry of
their Spirit Form. While they are still considered unarmed, they may use
the statistics of Unarmed, Light, or Medium Weaponry, with an added +1
to Base Damage. The category choice should be reflective of their Spirit
Formâ€™s natural weaponry.

The Beastman gains the size of **Large** (+1 Soak, +3 Endurance, and -2
successes on Fine Dexterity/Sneak rolls). This does not affect Lunars
who are already of size Large (or bigger).

If the animal form has natural armor, such as a carapace or scales, they
may gain an additional +1 Soak at the cost of -1 Evasion.

Aside from this, other mutations still follow the **Hybrid Body Rules**
(including their alteration from the Hybrid Body Rearrangement).

### Hide-Hardening Technique

**Cost:** (2m per Dmg)  
**Type:** Reflexive  
**Mins:** Physique 2, Shapeshifting 1

The Lunar reinforces their body, hardening their defenses against an
attack. They may reduce damage from a Decisive Strike at a cost of 2m
per point of damage, up to (Essence) times on a single Strike.

### Howling Visage

**Cost:** 5m 2i  
**Type:** Simple (Maneuver)  
**Mins:** Physique 3, Shapeshifting 2

The Lunar lets loose a great and terrifying Howl upon the battlefield,
using their (Strength + Physique) vs Resolve against all enemy
characters that are within Medium Range of the Lunar, and can either
hear or see them. On success, all who hear them lose 3 Impulse.

### Rip and Tear

**Cost:** 4m, 2i  
**Type:** Supplemental (Decisive)  
**Mins:** Physique 4, Shapeshifting 3

With raging claws, and teeth, the Lunar shreds their target apart,
dealing (Essence) additional Damage.

##########  Greater Techniques

### Halting the Scarlet Flow

**Cost:** 7m  
**Type:** Free Action  
**Mins:** Physique 5, Shapeshifting 4

The Lunar immediately regains (Shapeshifting + Essence) / 2 Endurance.

### Towering Giant Enhancement

**Cost:** --(2m)  
**Type:** Permanent (Free Action)  
**Mins:** Physique 5, Shapeshifting 5

Instead of becoming **Large** on entering the form, the Lunar may
instead become **Gigantic** (+2 Soak, No Fine Dexterity/Sneak, -2
Evasion, +5 End).

The Lunar may switch between **Large** and **Gigantic** as a Secondary
Action costing 2m.

Regardless of if the Lunar is Large or Gigantic, they gain an additional
+1 Base Damage.

<p>The Deadly Beastman Style is one of the most devastating ways a Lunar has to tear down their foes, but there is no way to hide the nature of the Lunar while using it.</p>
<p>Lunars will need to pick up another Martial Arts, or choose not to activate this style, if they have need of hiding thier true nature.</p></td>

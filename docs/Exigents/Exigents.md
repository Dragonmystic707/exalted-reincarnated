**<span class="smallcaps">One Thousand Gods</span>**
----------------------------------------------------

Creation is host to thousands upon thousands of Gods, elementals,
spirits, creatures of power, and even demons who may decide to uplift
their chosen mortal to be their champion—though doing so is often at
great cost to themselves.

Not all of these are “pure” Exalts: some are simply gifted temporary
power, some will find their power comes from external sources, and some
aren’t even mortals at all, but creatures from outside of Creation.
There are even cases where a spirit has fused with a mortal, bringing
out a new being altogether.

Whatever their source, and in spite of their precise taxonomy, Creation
deems these all as the “Exigent Exalted”--the Exalted of the “little
gods”.

Though, simply because they are Chosen by those that history skips over,
does not make them any less powerful than their peers.

### Creating an Exigent

Each Exigent is a unique creation, and so there is little binding one
Exigent to another. Rather, each will need to be **Custom made.**

The option does exist to craft an Exigent from the ground up, and there
are those experienced crafters may find joy in doing so. However, that
is not needed.

Exigents should be created by looking at what already exists, and
mixing, matching, and reflavoring to create that which is personal to
the character.

#### Step 1: Decide who your Benefactor is

You should have a clear picture in mind of what the creator of your
Exalt is—and what their power sets are. Are they the God of Luck? An
elemental that has merged with your spirit? Or perhaps they are a
creature of power from beyond the farthest reaches of Creation?

Whatever it is, all of your powers will be focused through this light,
and you should reflavor what you choose to match.

#### Step 2: Choose your Character Creation bonus

Choose **one** character creation bonus from the following:

-   Gain 5 dots of Abilities

-   Gain 3 dots of Attributes

-   Gain 2 dots of Attributes, and 2 Abilities.

-   Gain 1 Lesser Power

-   Gain 3 dots of Merits.

-   Permanently Gain 2 Motes to your pool.

#### Step 3: Pick Anima Abilities

Then, you may choose (or create) **any 2** Caste Anima Abilities, from
any Exaltation and/or caste. They do not have to match. For example, you
can choose one from the Solar Night, and another from the Lunar Changing
Moon.

#### Step 4: Pick Charm Sets

Choose (or create) **3** charm sets, and gain any associated
Supernatural Ability if there is one.

For example, if you are creating “Rip Tide”, the Chosen of the
evermoving and dangerous waters, you would choose the charm sets of
*Dawn (Solar), Water (Dragon-Blooded),* and *Shapeshifting (Lunar).* You
would gain access to the supernatural abilities of Water and
Shapeshifting.

<td><p>Focused Choices</p>
<p>You may have noticed that Exigents don’t have as wide a breadth as other Exalts—they have fewer charm sets to choose from, and not as many character creation bonuses as others.</p>
<p>This is simply because they are custom creations—and therefore their choices will be tailor-made to a specific character and idea, so there is nothing chosen that isn’t immediately used.</p>
<p>The other Exalted have to be far more general in their selection, and so there will often be some bonuses and selections given to characters that they will never use.</p></td>

#### Step 5: Choose Excellency

The last mechanical step when creating an Exigent type character (before
actual character creation), is to create or choose an Excellency—that
power which represents a character pushing past their normal limits, but
at great mental strain.

#### 

###  Creating an Excellency

When choosing or creating an Excellency, truly consider the thematic of
this power, as it is your most general, fallback ability. In particular,
consider the balance between consistency and power peaks.

The most consistent Excellency—the baseline—is “**Add +2 successes to
your roll**” with no qualifiers. This is a perfectly fine Excellency for
balanced, consistent powerset. To add more, you will have to add
limitations, according the concept of your Exaltation. Take the
following thought processes for existing Exalts:

-   **Solars** are known to excel at whatever they put their mind to.
    They are *consistently* good at doing so, and so add a straight
    number of successes with no need for rolling. However, they are left
    to the wind when attempting something they have not dedicated their
    life to—and so use their Ability score. They easily, consistently
    can get +5 to their roll, but at the cost of not being able to apply
    it to things they aren’t already good at.

-   **Lunars** are generalists, using primal powers (represented as
    Attributes) to their advantage. Their Excellency is always there for
    them should they choose to use it. However, their powers are far
    more mercurial than others, and so are represented as dice
    (typically 4-5 dice, or 2-2.5 successes on average). They can
    continue to push more and more, at the cost of more stress.

-   **Infernals** seek not to make themselves better, but to destroy
    that which is in the way. Instead of adding dice, they decrease the
    difficulty by destroying it. It has a similar mechanical effect as
    adding straight dice, but does come to the disadvantage that they
    can *never* excel at what they want to do. They therefore cannot
    gain Anima using the Excellency, nor ever change a pure failure (0
    successes) into a success no matter how hard they try.

Character Creation
==================

Aspects of the character are measured in **Dot Ratings**, the higher
number representing greater proficiency.

A **Power** is a general term to refer to Charms, Martial Arts
Techniques, Martial Arts Form, Spells, and Evocations.

[<u>Character
Sheets</u>](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Tvyc8eX5ICpKcWwEYOuWaB_10pEBPRhz?usp=sharing)

Steps
-----

1.  Choose your **Exaltation** and a **Caste/Aspect**, noting down any
    special abilities granted. Your Exaltation will influence everything
    about your character, ranging from what Charms can be chosen, Strife
    Expression, and Great Curse.

2.  Choose your character’s [**<u>Great Curse</u>**](#_l9b98etvmlp9),
    the character flaw which your Exalt struggles with day in and day
    out. Often, your character’s flaw will flare up, causing them to
    Botch their rolls, fail their actions, or otherwise veer them off of
    their intended course.  
      
    The Great Curse is often influenced by their Exaltation--Solars tend
    to have a flaw of Ego, Lunars by their loss of identity, and
    Sidereals by their complicated relationship with Fate, for example.

3.  Choose Three [**<u>Intimacies</u>**](#_26dfewrlr8wx), which
    represent your devotions or relations to ideas, people, or history.

4.  **Distribute 26 dots to Attributes**. No single Attribute may be
    lower than 1, nor higher than 5.  
      
    *Suggested Method:* **Set all Attributes to 1.** Choose which
    Categories (Physical, Social, Mental) are Primary, Secondary, and
    Tertiary. Then add:

    1.  **9 Dots** to Primary.

    2.  **5 Dots** to Secondary.

    3.  **3 Dots** to Tertiary.

5.  Mark **5** Abilities as **Favored**, and **immediately gain 1 dot
    rating in each.**  
      
    Most Exaltations will grant an additional specific Favored Ability
    (with its own free dot rating), bringing the total to **6.**

    1.  Use **9 dots** to increase Favored Abilities, with no single
        > Ability being higher than **5**.

    2.  **6 dots** in *non-Favored* Abilities, with no single Ability
        > raised higher than **3** during this phase.

6.  Choose Three Ability **Specialities,** in three favored Abilities.

7.  Choose a [**<u>Martial Arts Style</u>**](#_3t4ra6h9kwgj). Martial
    Arts dictates how your character interacts during combat, ranging
    from animal styles to esoteric and strange supernatural styles.

8.  Gain 15 [**<u>Resources</u>**](#_fin1amntrxu), which may immediately
    be spent on Merits. During character creation, Obstruction rolls are
    ignored.

9.  Gain **3 Lesser Powers,** each in an Ability that is **Favored.**

1.  Spend **30 xp** as desired.

2.  Specify Equipment the character carries, considering their
    background. Unlike other systems, Exalted does not require an
    extensive list of what equipment or tools the Exalt has on their
    person---so long as it is reasonable for them to have an item, they
    are considered to be carrying it. Mundane armor and weapons are
    included.  
      
    All Weapons and Armor are grouped into categories, which grants
    general bonuses, such as a “Medium Sword”. This represents the
    general size and weight of the equipment, and whether it favors
    accuracy, damage, soak, or evasion.  
      
    When making attacks, the weapon also determines whether the
    character primarily uses Force (Strength) or Finesse (Dexterity) in
    their attacks.

3.  Once the character sheet has been finalized, calculate the **Derived
    Static Values. (**The provided character sheets will do this for you
    automatically).

4.  **General Static Values**

    1.  **Personal Motes  
        > ***10 + (Essence)*  
        > The amount of essence the Exalt may use for their various
        > Powers that will *not* inflame their [<u>Anima
        > Banner</u>](#_wzcu53g1hrn6). Personal Motes regain slowly over
        > time.

    2.  **Peripheral Motes  
        > ***15 + (Essence) x2*  
        > The amount of essence the Exalt may use for their various
        > Powers. These motes *will* inflame their [<u>Anima
        > Banner</u>](#_wzcu53g1hrn6). Peripheral Motes are fully
        > regained at the start of a new Scene.

    3.  **Guile  
        > ***(Composure + Deception)/2*  
        > The Measure of how secretive a character can be, used to hide
        > their intentions, Intimacies, and reactions to Social
        > Influence.

    4.  **Resolve  
        > **(*Will + Integrity)/2*  
        > How resistant a character is to Mental influence, and not
        > being swayed to do actions they do not agree with.

Advancement
-----------

Essence increases automatically depending on how much xp has accumulated
after Character Creation:

-   Essence 2: 25 xp

-   Essence 3: 50 xp

-   Essence 4: 100 xp

-   Essence 5: 200 xp

Player Characters in the same group should be kept at the same amount of
experience points, so that no single character gets significantly ahead
or behind others.

For each session, each player should be given **Five XP** and **Two
RES**, in addition to any Extra XP or RES they may have earned.

### Extra XP

The Storyteller may grant extra xp (+2 each) for roleplay. All player
characters receive this bonus--while one character may initiate it, it
is a shared and cooperative experience to bring that about.

-   Reaching a milestone in a player character’s personal story.

-   Suffering a defeat, or otherwise being impeded in their journeys.

-   A character falling to their Great Curse, which changes the course
    > of the story in a non-insignificant manner.

### Gaining Resources

Resources should be sought out, and rewarded, based on the Player's
actions in the story. If they manage to acquire riches, or recruit
helpers to work, give them Resources to represent such actions.

Each individual **Keystone** *must* be intentionally sought out by the
player, and requires anywhere from a Scene to a full Story to acquire.

Each source of Resource should be added together when combined. For
example, by having access to the wealth and income of an entire city
(20) for a Season (50) would result in 70 RES.

Introduction
============

Character Creation
------------------

The Nocturnal gains access to the Supernatural Abilities of **Time**,
**Luck**, **Paradox.** The Nocturnal gains an additional **Favored
Ability** that must be placed in one of these Supernatural Abilities.

**Fluctuations** By spending a Strife Point, the Nocturnal may
temporarily alter the world in a way that still obeys the laws of
physics. This change should focus on one aspect of the scene that is
different, such as “What would this village look like if a historical
event happened differently”, or “What if this city had a lake”.

This change follows the same rules and logic as if it were a Project no
more than 10PR in cost, and must follow the **Rules of Anachronism.**
This change lasts for One Day, before reality snaps back into place.

**Renewal** On dying, and by spending a Strife Point, the Nocturnal
vanishes from the scene to another location they might have been at.
They then start a Day-long process of reincarnation into a possibility
of who they might have been. While they will have the same memories,
their personality, physical appearance, and gender might all change

If they are again killed during this renewal process, they will truely
die.

**Caste**
---------

**Nebula**

Spend a Strife Point. Your Anima banner expands around you like a fog,
up to (Essence x5) meters in radius. Those you choose who stand who
become suffused in it suffer -1 success on all Mental rolls. On
specifically perception rolls, they suffer -2 successes.

Supernatural Abilities
----------------------

### 

### Time

The endless river of time cannot be changed, but it can be altered,
manipulated, and used for the benefit of the Exalt.

The powers of time may be used to manipulate the speed of actions, skip
between near-events, and peer into the past or future for advantage.

**Rules of Anachronism**

-   Life and Death cannot be changed

-   Changes may only affect those with an (Essence) score less than the
    > Nocturnal.

-   Changes to the past are tricks, and will always snap back to the way
    > they were. However, effects caused by the altered past during the
    > scene will remain.

-   Changes must always follow the rules of possibility, and while
    > improbable, must still follow the rules of physics.

### Luck

\[\[Luck is the power of….luck. It’s pretty self-explanatory\]\].

**Chance Die**  
Luck often relies on Chance Die for their effects

### Paradox

Paradox is the holding of two contradictory possibilities at the same
time, as well as reversing cause and effect.

Strife Expression
-----------------

Nocturnal Luck

Spend a Strife Point, and select a Favored Ability. For the remainder of
the scene, whenever rolling with that Ability, do so twice, and take the
preferred result.

Great Curse

Nocturnals are plagued by **Consequences of Meddling**. Their Primary
Favored Supernatural Ability will often lash back in inopportune ways.
They may be forced to skip through Time, suffer from bad luck, or find
themselves trapped in a paradoxical consequence of their action.

Charms
======

Lesser Charms
-------------

### Familiar Face Confusion

**Cost:** 5m (committed)  
**Type:** Primary  
**Mins:** Deception 1, Luck 1

By chance, the Nocturnal is confused for another in a way that is
beneficial to the Nocturnal. This may either be by being mistaken for a
rank of an organization, or a specific person.

This may grant one temporary dot in a Merit such as Ally, Resources, or
Influence, or it may be as simple as being granted entry into a closed
party.

This charade lasts as long as the Nocturnal as Motes committed, until
the scene ends, or if the actual person/member of an organization the
Nocturnal is confused for shows up.

### Mind of the Mad Genius

**Cost:** 5m  
**Type:** Primary (Scene)  
**Mins:** Luck 3

A plan so daring, so implausible, so inefficient, and verging on madness
comes to Nocturnal.

The Player describes a plan so implausible, so dangerous, so inefficient
that it seems madness to even embark upon it.

And yet, should the proposed plan be carried through, the strategy will
work.

### Sometimes Apples Fly

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Reflexive (Scene)  
**Mins:** Athletics 3, Paradox 3

The Nocturnal cuts their bonds with the reality that exists, and instead
tethers their bonds to the pull of the Night Sky.

While motes are committed, gravity for the Nocturnal is inverted and
allows them to fall upwards. Fall damage still applies.

### Dual Face Observation

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Primary  
**Mins:** Paradox 2, Awareness 2

You may observe a person, or specific point from two places (that you
could normally access) at the same time.

You may use this to place a “sentinel self” to watch guard while your
“true self” is performing normal tasks.

### Improbable Response

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Reflexive  
**Mins:** Athletics 2, Paradox 1

A thousand possibilities flash before the Nocturnal’s form, allowing
them to predict an attack and move out of the way.

Reduce damage from an incoming attack by (Essence).

Martial Arts
============

Duality of Position Style
-------------------------

**Light Armor or Unarmored, Unarmed or Light**  
**Abilities:** Stealth, Paradox

The Martial Artist knows that the reality of position is malleable, and
more than one possibility exists.

When they enter this Form, the Stylist summons an alternate version of
themselves up to one range band away from their position. This visage of
themselves is called their “Shadow Copy”, which is a hazy visage of
their form cloaked in the fractured light of the alternate reality. It
gains +2 dice on all stealth rolls.

Whenever the Stylist takes a Move action, the shadow copy **must** also
take a Move action of the same magnitude and type, but in a different
direction.

As well, Instead of taking a move action, the Stylist may choose to swap
places with their shadow copy.

Lesser Techniques
-----------------

### Collapsed Waveform

**Cost:** 3m (committed)  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Stealth 1, Paradox 1

When the Stylist and their Shadow copy make a move action, they need not
cross the intervening space. Rather they entwine the possible where they
are already at their target location, and confuse reality into resolving
them into the desired location--which still must be *possible* for them
to reach in one action.

They make no footfalls to hear, for there are none to be made. They
disturb no traps, and portals such as doors remain unopened.

### Unresolved Duality

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Stealth 3, Paradox 2

The Stylist halfway transitions with their shadow copy. While making a
Flurry attack, they may attack any and all targets within reach of both
their original position or their shadow copy.

### Uncertain Direction Attack

**Cost:** 4m, 4i  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Stealth 4, Paradox 3

While making an attack in the same turn after swapping positions with
their shadow self, the Stylist strikes at their befuddled and confused
target, granting +(Essence) dice to their attack and making it
Undodgeable.

Greater Techniques
------------------

### Vanishing Act

**Cost:** 5m  
**Type:** Reflexive  
**Mins:** Stealth 4, Paradox 4

Upon being hit, the Stylist may reflexively swap places with their
shadow copy and sacrifice it, dividing the total damage of the attack in
half.

The Stylist will take the position of their shadow copy, and the copy
dissolves upon being struck, reforming on a spot next to the Stylist on
their next action.

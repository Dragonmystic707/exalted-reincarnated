Introduction
============

\[These are just notes, pardon the bad English. Writing through brain
fog.\]

Character Creation
------------------

Dragonbloods have access to the Elemental Words of: **Fire, Water, Air,
Earth,** and **Wood,** and has Aspects named the same.

Strife Expression
-----------------

### Fortitude of the Elements

Choose a Favored Ability. When you roll with that Ability, take either
the result of the roll, or the average of the roll. (I.e. If rolling
with 10 dice, you are guaranteed at least 5 successes.)

Aspect Strife
-------------

**Earth**: You may shape any earth around you, such as by raising a
defensible wall around a town, or boring a tunnel through a wall or
similar structure. So long as the material is natural earth, or made
primarily of it (such as hewn stone or bricks.) Forged metals such as
steel will resist this change, and materials such as artifacts are
unaffected.

Great Curse
-----------

The Curse manifests through the bloodline, and inflames the emotions,
personalities, virtue, or flaw of the character with raw elemental
might.

Typical interpretations:

**Fire Aspects** find that they become consumed by their passionsâ€”unable
to sit still, burning alive in their heart and compelled to do whatever
first flits into their mind, then turning to another at the drop of a
hat.

**Earth Aspects** become hyperfocused on one, only one idea. They cannot
be turned from it, cannot be distracted, and cannot be stopped

etc.

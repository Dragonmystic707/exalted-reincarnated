Martial Arts
============

Jade Mountain Style
-------------------

**Earth, Physique**

Any Armor, Club or Sword.

The Earth Dragon is relentless, and cannot be deterred from their
motions, or moved when they do not want to be. Gain +2 defense against
any actions to either forcibly move (knockback), or halt the movement of
the stylist.

As well, the stylist becomes encased in armor if they do not have any.
It has the same stats as artifact Heavy Armor. (+2 Soak, -1 Evasion.)

However, practitioners of the Jade Mountain Style must keep their feet
stabilized on solid ground. Breaking that connection for longer than a
simple jump will render the benefits of this style void, and unable to
activate techniques.

Earth Aspect Dragonbloods in totemic Anima Flare are always in
connection with the pole of Earth and may ignore this requirement.

### Boulder-Crushing Force

**Cost:** 2m  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Earth 2

Striking with overwhelming force, the stylist may target Soak instead of
DV on their attack.

### Pasiap Still Stands

**Cost:** (2m per dmg)  
**Type:** Reflexive; Turn  
**Mins:** Earth 2

The Stylist reinforces themselves with the strength of the earth itself.
When receiving an attack, or defending another, they may reduce the
damage dealt to them by up to (Essence), at a cost of 2m per health.

This damage is redistributed into the ground below the stylist,
cracking, tearing, and rippling through the earth or flooring,
potentially shattering and breaking the ground.

### Lesser Technique 3

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Supplemental.  
**Mins:** Earth 3

&lt;Reserved&gt;

### Falling Rockslide Onslaught

**Cost:** 7m  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Earth 4

The Stylist strikes the environment, sending a shock-wave of broken
earth to their target as a Ranged attack vs. Evasion.

Should the target fail, they will become trapped in an avalanche of
debris, unable to move for at least (Essence) rounds.

Regardless, the targeted area becomes a shattered wasteland of an
environmental hazard, requiring an Athletics roll to traverse.

### Greater Technique 2

**Cost:** 7m  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Earth 4

&lt;Reserved&gt;

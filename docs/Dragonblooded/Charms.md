### Echoes Caught in Stone

### Thicker than Stone

**Cost:** 2m  
**Type:** Reflexive  
**Mins:** Earth 2, Integrity 2

Your emotions and decisions are a bedrock, stabilizing not only
yourself, but those around you.

When another is threatened by a Social Action, you may grant use of your
Intimacies to them, allowing them to be used defensively.

### Elemental Bolt Attack

**Cost:** 2m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** (Element) 2

You may make a ranged elemental attack, treating it as a Medium Ranged
weapon.

Earth grants the ability to either restrain or push a character away
with force, at your choice, so long as this attack exceeds their Soak.

### Tremors

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Earth 3

Create an environmental earthquake, of at most two range bands in
diameter, for 3 Rounds.

To cross this area, characters must make an Althetics check vs. 3, even
if they do not contact the ground. If they fail, they take 3 damage.

### Wound-Denying DragonFaith

**Cost:** --  
**Type:** Reflexive; Scene  
**Mins:** Earth 4

Nothing may halt a Dragonblood that has started in motion.

Once per Story (and then at a cost of one Strife), the Exalt’s motions
cannot be stopped or halted by any means for the remainder of the scene.
They declare one target, such as reaching a position, person, or
completing a simple task. No bonds will hold them, nor any status halt
them in their tracks. They may be forced to sleep, mired in muck, or
have the fires of heaven raining down on them—yet their body will still
continue its movements. Their body will even continue moving through
death, holding on their Soul until the scene ends.

### Falsehood Unearthing Attitude

**Cost:** 6m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Earth 4

You understand the bedrock upon which people stand on—and when that rock
shakes and fails underneath them.

Make an Earth Roll. Should it succeed the target’s Resolve, you become
aware of an intimacy, secret, or concept that the target would be
willing to betray their own typical morals for.

### Impossible Strength

**Cost: --**  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Mins:** Earth 4

So long as you are in contact with natural stone (which exceeds your
body mass at least 2x), you may heave, heft, throw, tow, or otherwise
perform Feats of Strength at 10x your normal capacity.

### Wound-Denying DragonFaith

**Cost:** --  
**Type:** Reflexive; Scene  
**Mins:** Earth 4

Nothing may halt a Dragonblood that has started in motion.

Once per Story (and then at a cost of one Strife), the Exalt’s motions
cannot be stopped or halted by any means for the remainder of the scene.
They declare one target, such as reaching a position, person, or
completing a simple task. No bonds will hold them, nor any status halt
them in their tracks. They may be forced to sleep, mired in muck, or
have the fires of heaven raining down on them—yet their body will still
continue its movements. Their body will even continue moving through
death, holding on their Soul until the scene ends.

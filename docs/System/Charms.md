Universal Charms
================

Exalts, particularly new ones, will use their Essence to perform similar
effects. These charms are therefore Universal to all Exalts.

While the manifestation and method of these powers will look different,
the end result is the same. A Lunar might borrow the eyes of a falcon to
see further, while an Air Dragonblood would create a focal lens out of
the air—but they both would spend the same number of motes and end up
with the same perception advantage.

speed on a particular task for one month.

Alternatively, the Exalt may jam up the origination with some well
placed words, slowing down a task by ½ of its original pace.

Unknowable Visage
-----------------

**Cost: --**  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Mins:** Politics 3

Through vast experience, the deft Politician knows exactly how to disarm
and dismiss probing questions. They may define Guile as (Int +
Politics)/2.

As well, they cannot be subject to “Read Intentions” in response from
taking a Politics action.

Foul Air of Argument Technique
------------------------------

**Cost:** 8m  
**Type:** Simple; (Essence) Weeks  
**Mins:** Politics 4

The Exalt knows that a few well placed words are all it takes to crash
the trust of an organization. Exploit the weaknesses of a regional
organization, or a local charter. For the next (Essence) weeks, that
organization becomes mired in in-fighting, red-tape, and
miscommunication. All overt actions cease in the organization, trapped
on the course it was already headed on.

Only one target may be so influenced at a time, and the same target
cannot be affected more than once a Season.

Prematurely repairing the damage done by this charm is a 5 Res Project.

Socialize
---------

### Excellent Friend Approach

**Cost:** --  
**Type:** Permanent  
**Mins:** Socialize 1

The charms of the Exalt are hard to resist. So long as there is no
specific reason against it, Mortals and beings with Essence lower than
the Exalt’s will be friendly and cordial to them, even if they have just
met.

Irresistible Salesman Spirit
----------------------------

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Simple; Day  
**Mins:** Socialize 3

On a successful Socialize roll, instill a near-obsession level of
fascination, idea, or desire for a product in the target—so long as it
does not conflict with an existing Intimacy.

For a day, the target(s) gain an Intimacy towards the specified product,
and will attempt to pursue it, potentially leaving their posts or other
aspects of their life temporarily behind.

Subterfuge
----------

### Mimicry of Form

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Simple; Week  
**Mins:** Deception 1

After studying a mannerism of a target for a short time, such as
handwriting, voice, or even walking pattern, the Exalt may replicate it
as needed for a week, gaining (4) additional dice to do so.

### Hidden Meaning

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Deception 2

The Exalt hides their true meaning in inflections, allusions, and other
roundabout ways of speaking, writing, or other methods of communication.

The intended contact will be the only one who can divine the true
meaning of the conversation, but others may make a contested roll
(Cunning + Awareness) vs. the Exalt’s (Cunning + Lore) to notice that
there is a coded message.

### False Pursuit

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Deception 3

On a successful (Charisma + Deception) roll against the Guile of a
target, they become convinced that an ultimately benign or small point
of the Scene holds great value to their current goal. For example, they
may be convinced that the blades used murder are made of a special
composition, which is a keystone to their case, despite the blades being
only slightly out of normal make.

### Flashing Quill Atemi

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Simple  
**Mins:** Deception 4

With just a short moment in possession of a written text, the Exalt may
insert, expunge, or replace words as they see fit. No mundane means or
mortal characters will be able decipher the difference between the
altered content.

An Exalt, God, or other creature of power must successfully contest the
Guile of the forging Exalt to notice that the document has been altered
at all—let alone what specifically has been altered.

### Mind-Wiping Gaze

**Cost:** 6m  
**Type:** Reflexive; Scene  
**Mins:** Deception 5

The Exalt pierces the target with a gaze that penetrates the very soul,
extinguishing the flame of memories.

Interrupt a target taking a Social Influence action, or who is
attempting to communicate in a way. On a successful Deception vs. Guile
roll, the target loses their thoughts and memories regarding their
action and immediately fails on their action. In addition, they cannot
remember to pick the task up again until after the scene.

The given target may only be affected by this once per scene.

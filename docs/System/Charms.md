Universal Charms
================

Exalts, particularly new ones, will use their Essence to perform similar
effects. These charms are therefore Universal to all Exalts.

While the manifestation and method of these powers will look different,
the end result is the same. A Lunar might borrow the eyes of a falcon to
see further, while an Air Dragonblood would create a focal lens out of
the air--but they both would spend the same number of motes and end up
with the same perception advantage.

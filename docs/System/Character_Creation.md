Character Creation
==================

Aspects of the character are measured in **Dot Ratings**, the higher
number representing greater proficiency.

A **Power** is a general term to refer to Charms, Martial Arts
Techniques, Martial Arts Form, Spells, and Evocations.

Steps
-----

1.  Choose your **Exaltation** and a **Caste/Aspect**, noting down any
    special abilities granted. Your Exaltation will influence everything
    about your character, ranging from what Charms can be chosen, Strife
    Expression, and Great Curse.

2.  Choose your character’s [**<u>Great
    Curse</u>**](/General_System/#the-great-curse), the character flaw which
    your Exalt struggles with day in and day out. Often, your
    character’s flaw will flare up, causing them to Botch their rolls,
    fail their actions, or otherwise veer them off of their intended
    course.  
      
    The Great Curse is often influenced by their Exaltation--Solars tend
    to have a flaw of Ego, Lunars by their loss of identity, and
    Sidereals by their complicated relationship with Fate, for example.

3.  Choose Three [**<u>Intimacies</u>**](/Social/#intimacies), which
    represent your devotions or relations to ideas, people, or history.

4.  **Distribute 26 dots to Attributes**. No single Attribute may be
    lower than 1, nor higher than 5.  
      
    *Suggested Method:  
    *Set all Attributes to 1.  
    Assign each category (Mental, Social, Mental) to be your character’s
    Primary, Secondary, or Tertiary set. Then add:

    -   **9 Dots** to Primary.

    -   **5 Dots** to Secondary.

    -   **3 Dots** to Tertiary.

5.  **Abilities**

    -   Mark **5** Abilities as **Favored**, gaining 1 **free dot**
        each.

    -   Mark the (+1) Favored Ability granted from the Exaltation/Caste,
        gaining its 1 **free dot** as well.

    -   Use **9 dots** to increase Favored Abilities, with no single
        Ability being higher than **5**.

    -   **6 dots** in *non-Favored* Abilities, with no single Ability
        raised higher than **3** during this phase.

    -   Choose 3 **Specialities,** each in a seperate Favored Ability.

6.  Choose a [**<u>Martial Arts Style</u>**](-3t4ra6h9kwgj). Martial
    Arts dictates how your character interacts during combat, ranging
    from animal styles to esoteric and strange supernatural styles.

7.  Gain 15 **Resources**, which may immediately be spent on Merits.
    During character creation, Obstruction rolls are ignored.

8.  Gain **3 Lesser Powers,** each in an Ability that is **Favored.**

9.  Spend **30 xp** as desired.

<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Before spending xp, double check that your character has the following minimums:</p>
<p><strong>26</strong> Attribute Points</p>
<p><strong>14</strong> Favored Ability Points</p>
<p>(<strong>+1</strong> from Exaltation/Caste)</p>
<p><strong>6</strong> Non-Favored Ability Points</p>

1.  Specify **Equipment** the character carries, considering their
    background. Unlike other systems, Exalted does not require an
    extensive list of what equipment or tools the Exalt has on their
    person---so long as it is reasonable for them to have an item, they
    are considered to be carrying it. Mundane armor and weapons are
    included

2.  **General Static Values  
    **Record the following calculated static values

    -   **Personal Motes  
        **10 + (Essence)

    -   **Peripheral Motes  
        **15 + (Essence) x2

    -   **Guile  
        **(Composure + Deception)/2

    -   **Resolve  
        **(Will + Integrity)/2

 Advancement
-----------

Essence increases automatically depending on how much xp has accumulated
after Character Creation:

-   Essence 2: 25 xp

-   Essence 3: 50 xp

-   Essence 4: 100 xp

-   Essence 5: 200 xp

Player Characters in the same group should be kept at the same amount of
experience points, so that no single character gets significantly ahead
or behind others.

For each session, each player should be given **Five XP** and **Two
RES**, in addition to any Extra XP or RES they may have earned.

### Extra XP

The Storyteller may grant extra xp (+2 each) for roleplay. All player
characters receive this bonus--while one character may initiate it, it
is a shared and cooperative experience to bring that about.

-   Reaching a milestone in a player character’s personal story.

-   Suffering a defeat, or otherwise being impeded in their journeys.

-   A character falling to their Great Curse, which changes the course
    of the story in a non-insignificant manner.

### Gaining Resources

Resources should be sought out, and rewarded, based on the Player's
actions in the story. If they manage to acquire riches, or recruit
helpers to work, give them Resources to represent such actions.

Each individual **Keystone** *must* be intentionally sought out by the
player, and requires anywhere from a Scene to a full Story to acquire.

Each source of Resource should be added together when combined. For
example, by having access to the wealth and income of an entire city
(20) for a Season (50) would result in 70 RES.

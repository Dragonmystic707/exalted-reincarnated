Character Creation
==================

Aspects of the character are measured in **Dot Ratings**, the higher
number representing greater proficiency. Dot ratings range from **0-5**,
with 0 being untrained, 2 average, and 5 masterful.

Crafting Your Character
-----------------------

1.  Choose a name for your character. Often on the moment of Exaltation,
    the character takes a new name or title befitting their past deeds.

2.  Choose your **Exaltation** and associated **Caste.** noting down any
    special abilities granted.  
      
    Your Exaltation will influence everything about your character, from
    what charms they may take, so take some time exploring your options.

3.  Choose Three [**<u>Intimacies</u>**](/System/Social/#intimacies), which are
    simple sentences that describes your relation or devotions to
    certain ideals, people, or places. They should be aspects that are
    fundamental to your character—what shapes and drives them to do what
    they do.  
      
    Your Intimacies should answer the questions:

    -   What is a tie I have to the world around me? Why do I care
        whether the world is destroyed or not?

    -   What pushes me to continue forward, in spite of all the
        hardship, danger, and anguish I will encounter?

    -   Why do I stick with the party? Is there a particular character I
        resonate with? Do we share a common goal?

4.  Describe the [**Anima Banner**](/System/General_System/#anima-banner), which is the light
    of the very soul expressing itself to the world around it. While
    intensely personal, each anima Banner should have elements of their
    Exaltation incorporated in it—Solars will tend to the colors of gold
    and fire, Lunars will display their totem spirit.  
      
    The Anima Banner will show either at will, in response to powerful
    expenditures of Essence, or at times of large stress.

5.  Choose your character’s [**<u>Great
    Curse</u>**](/System/General_System/#the-great-curse), the character flaw which
    your Exalt struggles with day in and day out. Often, your
    character’s flaw will flare up, causing them to Botch their rolls,
    fail their actions, or otherwise veer them off of their intended
    course.  
      
    Example Great Curses are provided with your Exaltation, as each
    exalt tends to follow similar themes, but they by no means need to
    be followed verbatim.

    Describing a Great Curse should answer these questions:  
      
    **What is the flaw?  
    **How does the Curse describe your character? Are they overly
    compassionate, taking on the worlds ills onto themselves at their
    own detriment? Are they a braggart, who cannot help but show off?  
      
    **What aggravates it?  
    **What is something that you can encounter in the world that will
    cause the Great Curse to rear its ugly head? Is it the sight of
    those in power mistreating those that they are supposed to
    protect?  
      
    This should be an event that happens, on average, once every
    session. Work with your Storyteller and adjust it during play if it
    is occurring too often or nor showing up at all, as each story is
    different.  
      
    **What happens?  
    **When your character cannot take the accumulated stress of their
    adventures anymore, what action will they (most likely) take? Do
    they shut themselves off from the world? Do they take action,
    ignoring any potential consequences

6.  Distribute **26** dots into [Attributes](/System/Attributes/#attributes). Each must be
    at least 1, and no more than 5.  
      
    *Suggested Method:*  
    Set all Attributes to 1.  
    Assign each category (Pysical, Social, Mental) to be your
    character’s Primary, Secondary, or Tertiary set. Then add:

    -   **9 Dots** to Primary.

    -   **5 Dots** to Secondary.

    -   **3 Dots** to Tertiary.

7.  [**Abilities**](/System/Abilities/#abilities)

    -   Mark the Favored Ability granted from your Exaltation/Caste, and
        record Supernatural Abilities granted you have access to.

    -   Mark 5 additional Favored Abilities. These can be any
        combination of Natural, Trained, or Supernatural Abilities.

    -   Spend **18 dots** in Favored Abilities. All Favored abilities
        must have at least 1 dot.  
        *Suggested:* \[5,4,3,3,2,1\]

    -   Spend **9 dots** in *non-Favored* Abilities to round out your
        character. None can be higher than 3 at character creation.  
        *Suggested:* \[3,2,2,1,1\]

    -   Choose a [***<u>Specialty</u>***](/System/Abilities/#specialties) for each Trained
        Ability with at least 1 dot. Specializations are focused
        applications of an Ability, such as “Close Combat: Swords” or
        “Lore: Realm History”. If a character must work outside their
        specialty—in this case “Close Combat: Unarmed”, they suffer a -2
        dice penalty to their roll.  
          
        Example specialties are listed with each Trained ability, but
        you may come up with any description you prefer, so long as it
        is not too broad as to be practically all-encompassing.

8.  Gain **3 Favored Lesser Powers.**  
    You may take Powers from the list of Universal Charms, your Exalt’s
    Charms, Martial Arts Techniques, Spells from Sorcery, and/or
    Evocations from an Artifact.  
    Greater Powers require Essence 3, and Capstone Powers require
    Essence 5.

9.  Detail out the [Armor and Weapons](/System/Combat/#armor-and-weapons) your
    character uses. Any other mundane equipment the character has need
    not be written down—so long as it is a reasonable thing for your
    character to carry, it may be used.

1.  [**Merits**](/System/Merits/#merits)

    -   Mark down two **Facts** of your character, which are simple
        statements describing your past.

        -   One should be dedicated to your history, such as the city
            they lived in, or if they are from an important family
            lineage.

        -   The other should be dedicated to a past accomplishment.
            Often, this is directly tied to why you were chosen to be an
            Exalt.

    -   Mark down the two standard languages: one representing your
        local tongue, and one common to the all the Player Characters
        (typically the Trade tongue: Riverspeak).

    -   Gain **20** Resources, with which to purchase additional merits.
        Keep any unspent Resources.  
        *Suggested:* \[3,2,1,1\]  
          
        With special Storyteller permission, you may start with a 4-dot
        merit, and in debt by 1 Keystone. This takes the form of a
        problem with the merit, story tie, or other plot hook that
        should be resolved in order to remove the Keystone debt. See
        [***<u>Projects</u>***](/System/Projects/#projects) for more details.

 Finishing Touches
-----------------

Once your character has been finalized, it is time to record static
values. If you are using the provided character sheet, this next part
will be completed automatically.

1.  Set your [***<u>Essence</u>***](/System/General_System/#essence) to 1, the starting point
    for all Exalts. This sets you apart from most mortals who do not
    have an essence rating at all. (Essence 0).  
      
    Essence level will increase automatically as you gain experience in
    the world.

<!-- -->

1.  Record the **Mote Pools** of Essence: your currency for empowering
    your mighty charms and spells. You start with your mote pools
    completely filled. There are two values:

    -   **Personal Motes**: Set to 12.  
        *(Essence)x2 + 10*  
        The first mote pool to be drawn from, but only replenishes
        Daily.

    -   **Peripheral Motes:** Set to 10.  
        Once the personal mote pool has been exhausted, more energy may
        be pulled from the world itself—though this causes the anima
        banner to flare. Replenishes at the start of every Scene.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Rounding<br />
</strong>When determining static values, always round up to the nearest whole number.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

1.  **Guile  
    ***(Composure + Subterfuge)/2  
    *Used to conceal your intentions, motivations, and Intimacies from
    other in social situations.

2.  **Resolve  
    ***(Willpower + Integrity)/2  
    *Used to defend against anything that would sway your mind and
    actions, from deceptively sweet words to mind-altering Spells.

3.  **Health**  
    5 + *(Essence)x3 + (Stamina)x2 + (Physique)*  
    In a combat scene, represents how long you may remain in the fight
    before collapsing from fatigue.

4.  **Evasion**  
    *(Dexterity + Athletics)/2* *+ (Armor Modifier)*  
    Allows you to dodge and avoid incoming attacks. Often the best
    defense is to not be hit in the first place. Does nothing against
    certain attacks, such as room-filling explosions.

5.  **Soak**  
    *(Stamina + Physique)/2* *+ (Armor Modifier)*  
    Being hit is inevitable, and the best defense is to mitigate,
    deflect, or otherwise absorb the damage. Does nothing against
    certain attacks, such as piercing attacks.

6.  **Defense Value (DV)**  
    *Greater of Evasion or Soak*  
    For many cases, either Evasion or Soak works well enough, and so
    calls for the generic value of DV.

7.  **Accuracy**  
    *(Weapon Att. + Weapon Ability)/2 + (Weapon Acc)*  
    The Attribute and Ability you use to calculate accuracy is dependent
    on your weapon. For example, a Heavy Maul will require Strength and
    Close Combat, while a Light Bow would require Dexterity and Ranged
    Combat. See [Weapons](/System/Combat/#armor-and-weapons).

8.  **Base Damage  
    ***(Weapon Damage) + (Essence)*  
    With every attack, there is a minimum, or base amount of damage that
    is dealt, as determined by the weapon you used in the attack and
    your essence level.

Advancement
-----------

Essence increases automatically depending on how much **total** xp has
been gained.

|             |                |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Essence** | **Experience** |
| 1           | 0              |
| 2           | 25             |
| 3           | 50             |
| 4           | 75             |
| 5           | 100            |
| 6 (+)       | 150 (+50)      |

Each Essence Rank provides:

-   +3 Health

-   +1 Base Damage

-   +2 Personal Motes

Player Characters in the same group should be kept at the same amount of
experience points, so that no single character gets significantly ahead
or behind others.

For each session, each player should be given **Three XP** and **Two
RES**, in addition to any Extra XP or RES they may have earned.

<p>Each Essence Level past 6 requires 50 xp.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Extra XP

The Storyteller may grant extra xp (+2 each) for each distinctive moment
of roleplay. All player characters receive this bonus—while one
character may initiate it, it is a shared and cooperative experience to
bring that about. Examples include:

-   Reaching a milestone in a player character’s personal story.

-   Suffering a defeat, or otherwise being impeded in their journeys.

-   A character falling to their Great Curse, which changes the course
    of the story in a non-insignificant manner.

1.  

### Gaining Resources

Resources should be sought out and rewarded, based on the Player’s
actions in the story—it represents riches to favors to manpower
gathered.

Each individual **Keystone** *must* be intentionally sought out by the
player, and requires anywhere from a Scene to a full Story to acquire.

Each source of Resource should be added together when combined. For
example, by having access to the wealth and income of an entire City
(20) for a Month (5) would result in 25 Res.

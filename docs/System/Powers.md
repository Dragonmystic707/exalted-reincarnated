Powers
======

The word “Powers” refers to the various sources of supernatural effects
the Exalt can have upon the world, including (but not limited to):
Charms, Evocations, Spells, and Martial Arts Techniques.

System Presentation
-------------------

Powers are presented in a manner similar to the following:

> **Cost:** 2m  
> **Type:** Primary  
> **Mins:** Awareness 3  
> **(Prerequisite)**

### Cost

Designates what character resources it takes to use the Power. A Power
of no cost (such as Permanent effects) will be designated with “--”.

-   **m—**Motes of Essence, which can be a chosen combination of
    Personal or Peripheral

    -   Some Powers will specifically designate (personal) or
        (peripheral) in their cost.

-   **i—**If used in a Combat Scene, requires **Impulse**. If used in an
    Encounter Scene, requires **Influence.**

-   **sm—**Sorcerous Motes, which are described in more detail in the
    [<u>Sorcery</u>](/System/Sorcery_and_Necromancy/#sorcery-and-necromancy).

### Type

The Power’s Type designates how the power may be activated, and then how
long it is active for in the format:

**Type:** (Activation Type); (Duration)

So, a Power that activates *Reflexively* and is then *active* for the
remainder of the scene would be written as:

**Type:** Reflexive; Scene

If there is no duration written, the power is considered *Instant*, and
immediately dissipates after activation.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Terminating Active Powers</p>
<p>An Exalt may willfully terminate a Power early, should they desire. However, they must then pay the activation cost again if they want to reactivate the power.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### 

#### **Activation Type**

-   **Simple.** Consumes an Action Slot. Only one Action may be taken
    per turn.

-   **Free Action**. Does not consume an Action Slot, but must still be
    activated on the character’s Turn. (i.e. not Reflexively.)

-   **Supplemental.** Enhances a Primary or Secondary Action. There is
    no limit to the number of supplemental Powers that may be combined
    together.

-   **Reflexive**. Conditional powers that may be used outside of normal
    turn order. So long as the condition is met, the Reflexive Power may
    always be used.

-   **Permanent**. Once purchased, this power is always active.

### Prerequisite

Occasionally, some Powers will require the purchase of another Power
first. If this exists, the prerequisite charm will be listed here.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Timing Conflicts</p>
<p>If there is ever a timing conflict, such as with two Reflexive Charms going off at once, the resolution goes according to the <em>defender’s choice</em>.</p>
<p>If that is still unclear, there should be a contested roll using the relevant <em>Finesse</em> Attribute: Dexterity, Insight, or Cunning.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Minimum Requirements

When buying a Power, there are certain Minimums that must first be
met—such as the dot Rating in a specific Ability.

Glossary of Terms
-----------------

There are specific words and phrases that charms commonly use as a
shorthand for mechanical actions—so that the power description isn’t
constantly cluttered with the same mechanical saying.

-   **On Hit** Any Action, including Maneuvers and the Accuracy Roll,
    which exceeds a target’s DV. Unless otherwise stated, this hit must
    be on an action from the character, using the Ability that the Power
    is under.

    -   Sometimes the Power will explicitly target Evasion or Soak.

-   **Feats of Strength** Rolls, typically using Strength and Physique,
    with the intent of expressing physical prowess—hefting boulders,
    breaking walls, carrying tons, etc

Charms
------

Charms are the natural expression of a character’s essence, a specific
and trained way for their internal power to be expressed upon the world.

These powers are inherently personal, and each expression will vary from
individual to individual: those that are listed are simply
generalizations and categorization for easy shorthand.

Typically, a character does not know they are using a specific charm: it
is simply an instinctual channeling of essence to produce the desired
effect.

### Greater Charms

Greater Charms are powers more powerful, and far more complicated to
learn and perfect than a normal Charm.

A character must first be at **Essence 3** to learn a Greater Charm, and
it will cost **double** the amount of XP to learn.

#### Use Sparingly: Dice Tricks (TN Shifting, Double X’s)

“Dice Tricks” are effects that rely on the face values of dice, and
often contain wording such as “Whenever a 1 is rolled…” These types of
mechanics should be considered **very carefully**, and used **extremely
sparingly**.

When using a Dice Pool system, such as Exalted does with its (Att+Abi)x
d10’s, all players around the table will start to rely on *memorization*
of dice faces as symbols, rather than individually interpreting the
numbers.

In essence, people will start to quickly stop seeing the numbers:

**{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }**

Instead, minds will short circuit this: seeing it as the much more
manageable:

**{ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2 }**

If you create a power that has “Dice tricks” built into it, such as
doubling any number with an 8 or higher, *you mess with this
short-circuit memorization*. This will slow down play considerably as
players will suddenly have to focus on the dice, reinterpret the dice as
actual numbers again, and then potentially undo their memorization.

**Only use a Dice Trick if it is necessary**. A sparing number of these
effects here and there--perhaps restricted by a conditional--is fine.
But if too many of them appear, it will slow down play considerably!

Judging Costs
-------------

-   Lesser Charms should have mins from 1-3 (maybe 4)

-   Greater Charms should have Mins from 3-4 (maybe 5)

-   Effects in the Maneuver Stunts table should be 2m at base. If you
    improve them, no more than 5m.

-   Targeting Evasion/Soak is 3m, 1i. Targeting a non-standard defense
    is 4m, 2i.

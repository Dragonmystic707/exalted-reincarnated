Projects
========

From waging a campaign to spreading a mercantile Guild to infiltrating
and converting a spy network, to building a grand Manse, sometimes the
Exalted want to do long-reaching, large-scale endeavors that are best
handled through a broad-stroking brush.

All characters can perform projects, and the nature of the project is
informed by their abilities. Social characters interact with masses of
people to form networks; martial characters can train and inform troops;
crafter characters can create tools, manses, artifacts.

Resources
---------

Projects require a certain number of **Resources (RES)** to complete.
This resource is a generalized representation of everything from labor,
physical materials, knowledge, and the like that can be applied to the
Project. Once applied to the project, RES is permanently consumed—while
the labor force may still be there, perhaps payment toward them ran dry,
or they can no longer delay tending to their crops.

Much like XP, The Storyteller should periodically award RES to the
players. However, unlike XP, RES should be more based on events within
the campaign, such as recovering materials from a lost manse, gaining
the workforce of a thankful village, etc.

### Keystone Resource

Larger and more ambitious projects will require certain Keystone to
complete. This can range from needing a General to command an army to
requiring a significant amount of *magical materials,* such as
Orichalcum or Moonsilver.

Keystone Resources are things that Players must *seek out*, which may
spawn scenes, or even an entire Story!

### Converting Resources

Due to the generalized nature of Projects, the source of RES does not
always match the application of them. It is simply assumed as part of
the Project that RES is converted into the most applicable asset, based
on a series of complicated trades and "off-screen" character activities:
recovered gems could grease the eye of a noble, allowing for backroom
deals that allow military training of civilians, for example. In
general, this is all *assumed* to have happened, and does not need
attention drawn to it.

In essence: RES is universally transitive.

One caveat is that the completion of a Project must be *possible*, given
the time and circumstances of the characters. A militia cannot suddenly
appear in the middle of the abandoned wilds simply because the player
finally got enough RES after this session.

### Pooling Resources

Players may freely transfer and give RES to other characters, should
they so choose.

The Right Tool for the Job
--------------------------

\[\[You need to choose an ability you are working off of.

The project you are undertaking must be justified in what you are doing.
You are socializing to make a spy network, crafting to outfit an army,
doing a sorcerous working to raise manses.

Anything that doesn’t match can’t be done.\]\]

### Gaining/Improving Merits

**Projects** can be a way for characters to gain or improve Merits. For
example, the character might decide to recruit *Followers*, establish a
network of *Contacts*, or make an *Artifact*.

Common Sense, and the Storyteller’s approval, should be applied when
gaining or improving a merit. People generally don’t simply just grow
*Extra Limbs* out of the blue…unless they are in the deepest recesses of
the Wyld.

If a character is *improving* a Merit to a higher rating, they pay the
*difference* in RES, Keystones, and time between the ratings. For
example, improving *Contacts* from Rating 1 to Rating 2 would be the
difference between a Minor and Basic Project: 4 RES and 6 days.

Obstruction Rolls
-----------------

All projects, save Basic Projects, will have at least one Obstruction
Roll. These are events that pop up during the Project that can
potentially derail, complicate, or even aid in the project.

If a Project requires multiple Obstruction rolls, it should be spaced
out roughly evenly across the lifespan of the project.

For each Obstruction Roll, the player should roll a single d10:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><blockquote>
<p>Roll 1d10</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td></td>
<td>Result</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><blockquote>
<p>10</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p><strong>Critical Success:</strong> Everything has seemingly clicked into place, providing an extra benefit.</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><blockquote>
<p>7-9</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>Everything is proceeding exactly as planned.</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><blockquote>
<p>4-6</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>An <strong>Oddity</strong> has developed and the Exalt's direct attention is requested.</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><blockquote>
<p>2-3</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Something of great import has happened, and requires your direct attention</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><blockquote>
<p>1</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p><strong>Major Problem</strong>: The project is in <em>dire straits</em>, and will collapse if not attended to right now!</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Critical Success

\[\[ Examples of extra benefits that can happen\]\]

### Oddities 

Oddities are events that, while unexpected, are not directly harmful to
the completion of the project. They could potentially be a boon, even,
but require direct attention of the Exalt to resolve.

-   Beastmen have heard of your militia, and wish to join. Current
    members are uneasy and do not wish them to without your input.

-   Your cult desires a clarification on one of your rules: currently
    one of the members is in violation of the technical aspects of the
    law, but not the spirit.

-   The magical materials to create your artifact were slightly flawed,
    leading to a variance in essence flow. It might lead to a new and
    unintended strange power.

### Problems

Problems, if not dealt with, will set back the Project.

-   A spy has not returned on time. You know they are not simply late.

-   Loss of a minor cache of resources. A spirit has started to disrupt
    the village.

-   An explosion rocked your campsite.

-   Supply lines are being disrupted.

-   Rumors of the Wyld hunt are near your border, but are unproven.

### Major Problem

A Major Problem will derail the entire project if not dealt with.

-   Your workers have split into two different groups, on the brink of a
    civil war.

-   There seems to be an element inside your organization actively and
    effectively disrupting your society.

-   One of the magical materials was corrupted with Vitriol, and has
    started to speak the demon-tongue of Malfeas.

Resolving Obstructions
----------------------

Oddities and Problems can usually be handled with a short scene with the
Player explaining how the character handles the situation.

Major Problems, on the other hand, usually take at least a full scene,
and potentially an entire session to resolve.

Cost
----

The total **Cost** of a Project is equivalent to the Base cost,
multiplied by the sum of any opposition.

You must have a base score in the related Ability to start a Project.

### Repairing, Altering, or Destroying Projects

Some Projects focus on altering an existing aspect of the world—such as
repairing a great Manse or taking an existing network of people and
converting them to work for you, or completely eradicating it
altogether.

Since much of the work has been done already, these types of Projects
will be *reduced in scale*, depending on the severity of the repairs or
changes needed to be made.

Destruction of a Projects focuses more on doing so *safely*, and in a
controlled manner.

-   **Minor** (-2 to Scale). The repairs and/or changes needed to be
    made are significant enough to warrant attention, but will not
    consume the Character endlessly.

-   **Major** (-1 to Scale). There is significant damage or resistance
    to your changes.

-   **Monumental** (-0 to Scale). It would be the same amount of effort
    to repair and or alter the Project as it would be to create a new
    one from the ground up.

This cannot decrease the Scale below 0.

There’s a Size 3 Assassin network the Eclipse Caste has recently become
the leader of. Being a pacifist, he wants them to stop killing and
convert into simply a network of Spys. There is enough internal
resistance to this command that he must make a Minor Alteration Project
(*Base 3, -2) and so it becomes a Scale 1 Project.*

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Altering Owned Projects</strong></p>
<p>You can’t alter a Project if someone else <em>currently</em> owns it. You would first have to depose the current leader of a Spy Network and <em>then</em> take over the leaderless network as your own.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Opposing Modifiers

When making a change on the world, sometimes the world pushes back.
Modifiers will multiply the Resource cost of the Project.

Opposition Modifiers are typically *active*

If there are any Powers or effects that modifies the Resource cost,
first resolve those and *then* apply this multiplier.

**x2 - Significant**

-   Results in a minor, but permanent supernatural force.

    -   Crafting a well that supernaturally purifies water and is never
        empty.

-   Change is *directly* opposed by powerful entities, ranging from
    mortal nations to other Exalted.

    -   Getting a Spy network loyal to a Solar costs more in the Realm
        than it does the Hundred Kingdoms.

**x4**

-   Results in a permanent, significant supernatural force.

    -   Something that will constantly mutate those it interacts with.

-   Opposed by powerful forces, such as the Deep Wyld, Gods, or a
    High-Level Exalted.

Example Projects:

-   Arming Militia

-   Repairing a burned down village

-   Establishing a spy network

-   Repairing a manse

-   Establishing trade

-   Creating a manse

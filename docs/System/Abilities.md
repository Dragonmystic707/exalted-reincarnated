Abilities
=========

Abilities are skills that have been honed, trained, and developed
through education and experience. Abilities may range from Zero (0) to
Five (5).

There are two types of abilities: **Natural, and Supernatural.** Natural
Abilities are those that any mortal (and thus Exalt) has the capacity to
learn, improve, and perform upon. Characters may always roll with a
**Natural** **Ability.**

**Supernatural Abilities** are those that only may be accessed by
dealing with the supernatural aspects of the world. Sorcery, Necromancy,
Shapeshifting, and control of Fire are all examples.

Characters must be somehow inducted into a Supernatural Ability to
purchase dots in the ability, or roll with it. Often, access will be
granted by Exaltation, though there are other means of being inducted.

Specialties
-----------

Abilities are broad fields of human accomplishment and skill. For an
Exalt, the variance in competence across these subsets of the Ability is
generally so small it does not affect the dice roll.

However, there are a small number of smaller skills that the Exalt
*excels* at. These are called *Specialties.*

When Rolling in an Ability Specialty, roll with an additional +1 die.

Specialties do **not** affect Static Values.

Natural Abilities
-----------------

### Archery

Mastery of ranged weapons that propel projectiles. The bow and arrow is
the dominant form, but other examples range from the mechanical
crossbow, to slings, to even the exotic flamepiece that shoots streamers
of fire.

**Combat:** Archery attacks are Ranged.

#### Sample Specialties

-   Bow

-   Crossbow

-   Flamepiece

-   Slings

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Ammunition</strong></p>
<p><em>Exalted</em> does not require the Player to keep track of their character’s ammunition. It is simply assumed that the character has crafted or procured enough ammunition to perform their actions.</p>
<p>However, Storytellers may introduce a lack of ammunition as a <a href="#Complication|outline">Complication</a> into the story, granting the Player a Strife Point in exchange. Like all complications, the Player must accept the Strife Point for it to take effect.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Athletics

Athletics is a measure of *physical motion.* It is useful for all ranges
of activity, both prolonged marathons and quick sprints.

Athletics is used to calculate the Static Values **Evasion** and
**Endurance.**

#### Sample Specialties

-   Running

-   Climbing

-   Swimming

### Awareness

Awareness is a measure of alertness and impromptu understanding of
events through any and all of the senses. Characters with high Awareness
are in tune-consciously or subconsciously-of everything that happens
around them.

#### Sample Specialties

Specialties in Awareness are location dependent, reflecting what sort of
background the character grew up in. Those born out in the wilderness
would find themselves overwhelmed by the large crowds in a city, for
example.

-   Wilderness

-   Cities

-   Political Gatherings

### Brawl 

Mastery of form that uses the body itself as a natural weapon. Punches,
kicks, grapples, and leg sweeps are but a fraction of the endless ways
generations have devised ways of harming each other.

Brawl is *generally* performed Unarmed, but weapons that strengthen or
reinforce the natural body form—such as brass knuckles, tiger claws, or
even spike-tipped boots—are still part of the Brawling Ability.

**Combat:** Brawl attacks are Close Range.

#### Sample Specialties

-   Punching

-   Kicking

-   Grappling/Restraints

### Craft

Craft is used to produce, analyze, and repair physical constructs and
moving parts. A crafter knows how to take even raw discard material and
turn it into a wondrous, complicated machine intended for a variety of
mechanical purposes, from fending off attacks to plowing a field.

#### Sample Specialties

-   Carpentry

-   Jerry-Rigging

-   Blacksmithing

-   Stone-working

-   Cloth-working

### Deception

Deception is the art of trickery, manipulation, and bold-faced lying.
Its masters are adept at getting people to do what they want without
them even realizing an outside influence is even there. Deception is
used to calculate **Guile**.

#### Sample Specialties

-   Forgery

-   Sleight of Hand

-   Conceal evidence

-   Misdirection

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Everyone can Lie</p>
<p>Deception is the natural ability for liars to gravitate towards, but it is not <em>required</em> for lying. Every person and every ability, has the ability to misdirect and lie. Deception is just the purest expression of this.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Integrity 

Integrity is a measure of how tightly a character can keep to their
convictions, goals, and objectives. It is used to calculate the Static
Value of **Resolve**.

Uniquely, Integrity does *not* have specialties. Rather, this is handled
through the **Intimacy** system.

### Leadership

Leadership covers the skills necessary to manage, inspire, and otherwise
command large groups of people to act as one unified whole.

#### Sample Specialties

-   Oratory

-   Organization

-   Tactics

### Lore

Lore is both the breadth and depth of understanding in the world,
ranging from geographic knowledge to religion and philosophy.

While Lore is the most broad application of knowledge, it is **not
exclusive.** All Abilities can attempt an (Int+Ability) roll to know
about their particular subject. Recognizing a famous swordsman, for
example, could both be an (Int + Melee) and (Int + Lore) roll.

#### Sample Specialties

-   Geography

-   History

-   Cryptography

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>The Non-Omniscient Scholar<br />
</strong>Having a high Lore does not confer <em>absolute truths</em> upon a character-rather it represents being well-versed in what is known--and often as much as what is unknown.</p>
<p>It is a fact that the Immaculate Order claims that Solars and Lunars are Anathema. It is a fact that many other societies claim. High lore will allow knowledge that these two facts exist, but not which one of them are right.</p>
<p>Storytellers should keep a character’s background (and specialty) in mind when revealing information to players--phrasing information through such natural biases.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Melee

Mastery of close range combat that uses a weapon as their primary method
of felling their foe.

Over the millennia of human history, there have been countless styles
and forms of weapons made. Specialties therefore are *representative* of
how the weapon is used: A spear could be used as a Sword, Staff, or
Spear, for example.

**Combat:** Melee attacks are Close Range.

#### Sample Specialties

-   Swords

-   Clubs

-   Staff

### Navigation

Navigation is the ability to traverse terrains—from land, to sea, to
jungle—and come out unscathed and on time. A trained Navigator will know
their hand at reigns, the stern of a ship, how to survive in a city’s
underworld, as well as be able to tell you which wild fruit is poisonous
or edible.

#### Sample Specialties

-   Ocean

-   Wilderness

-   Urban

-   Tracking

### Performance

Performance is the measure of not only how well a character is in the
technical nature of singing, dancing, or other such artistic expression,
but the ability to convey meaning and thoughts through those actions. A
skilled performer not only knows how to entertain their crowd, but also
knows how to incite that crowd into a frenzied riot should they desire.

#### Sample Specialties

-   Dance

-   Singing

-   Acting

-   Poetry/Linguistics

### Physique

Physique is the measure of fortitude and well-being, strength and
hardiness: the ability to shrug off attacks, poisons, and any
debilitation of the body. As well, it is used for tests of endurance,
and for feats of Strength. Physique is used to calculate **Soak**, as
well as **Endurance**.

#### Sample Specialties

-   Lifting

-   Crushing

-   Resistance (poisons/toxins)

### Politics

Politics is the maneuvering and manipulation of groups of
ideological-similar people. M A character skilled in Politics will be
able to manipulate peoples according to their will.

Specialties in Politics focus on either the *type* of politics at work
(Bureaucracy, Small-town), or specific political parties. Generally
speaking, the larger and more powerful a Political Party, the more
necessary the specialization needs to be tailor-made for them.

#### Sample Specialties

-   Bureaucracy

-   Guild

-   Specific Political Party

-   Undercity

### Socialize

Socialization is a way to relate and talk with people, making them feel
heard and personally connected with them.

Characters with high Socialize will be able to congenially relate to
people, softening their stance on things, and open them up for
persuasion to the character’s side. As well, they can often get a target
talking, making them speak more than they should have.

#### Sample Specialties

-   Charm

-   Beguilement

-   Information Extraction

-   Fast-Talking

### Stealth

Stealth is the ability to avoid detection-through any sense. They know
how to carry their body, which ways shadows cast, as well as creating
disguises and blending into crowds.

#### Sample Specialties

-   Disguise

-   Crowds

-   Hiding

-   Pick-pocketing

-   Shadowing

### Thrown

Thrown focuses on Ranged Combat where the entire (or vast majority) of
the weapon is hurled at the opponent, rather than projectiles.

**Combat:** Thrown attacks are Ranged.

#### Sample Specialties

-   Javelin (Spear, Atlatl, dart)

-   Bladed (knives, shuriken, kunai, dart, axes)

-   Simple (Sling, blowgun, boomerang)

-   Chakram

Supernatural Abilities
----------------------

**Supernatural** **Abilities** are those that are beyond the reach of
even the most talented mortal. No amount of training or skill can induct
a mortal into an Supernatural Ability-only by special circumstances will
the domain of the Gods be opened to them-such as Exaltation. Even then,
it is often a limited selection.

For example, those chosen to be a Dragon-Blooded are opened up to the
Elemental Abilities of Fire, Water, Air, Earth, and Wood, but are
restricted from the Lunar’s Shapeshifting Ability.

A minimum of Rating One is required to perform any Supernatural Ability,
and it cannot be learned without a specific Merit or Exaltation.

Since Supernatural Abilities are so closely tied with an Exaltation,
Gods, or Creature of Power, they will be detailed in their respective
books.

### Sorcery

Sorcery is the manipulation and

**\[\[Hey it’s sorcery! \]\]**

### Necromancy

**\[\[and I’m Necromancy! \]\]**

Creating New Abilities
----------------------

The provided Abilities are not considered comprehensive or exclusive
list-simply a selection that is expected to be most useful in the
*Exalted* setting. New Abilities may be made as needed or desired. For
example, a modern setting would ask for the abilities *Firearms* and
*Drive.*

Abilities do not need to be exclusive from each other, nor do their
descending Charms. It is perfectly acceptable to have two abilities that
overlap.

If the custom Ability is close to an existing one, and charms could
reasonably be used for one Ability or the Other, the Storyteller should
allow one purchase of the charm to be used for both abilities. For
example: if a character decides they want to create an “Architecture”
ability in the similar vein to the “Craft” ability, they could
reasonably purchase craft charms once and use them both for Architecture
and Craft.

### Example: Drive

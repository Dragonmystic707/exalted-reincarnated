Character Creation
==================

Aspects of the character are measured in **Dot Ratings**, the higher
number representing greater proficiency.

A **Power** is a general term to refer to Charms, Martial Arts
Techniques, Martial Arts Form, Spells, and Evocations.

Steps
-----

1.  Choose your **Exaltation** and a **Caste/Aspect**, noting down any
    special abilities granted. Your Exaltation will influence everything
    about your character, ranging from what Charms can be chosen, Strife
    Expression, and Great Curse.

2.  Choose your character’s [**<u>Great
    Curse</u>**](/General-System/#the-great-curse), the character flaw which
    your Exalt struggles with day in and day out. Often, your
    character’s flaw will flare up, causing them to Botch their rolls,
    fail their actions, or otherwise veer them off of their intended
    course.  
      
    The Great Curse is often influenced by their Exaltation--Solars tend
    to have a flaw of Ego, Lunars by their loss of identity, and
    Sidereals by their complicated relationship with Fate, for example.

3.  Choose Three [**<u>Intimacies</u>**](-26dfewrlr8wx), which
    represent your devotions or relations to ideas, people, or history.

4.  **Distribute 26 dots to Attributes**. No single Attribute may be
    lower than 1, nor higher than 5.  
      
    *Suggested Method:* **Set all Attributes to 1.** Choose which
    Categories (Physical, Social, Mental) are Primary, Secondary, and
    Tertiary. Then add:  
      
    **9 Dots** to Primary.  
    **5 Dots** to Secondary.  
    **3 Dots** to Tertiary.

5.  Mark **5** Abilities as **Favored**, and **immediately gain 1 dot
    rating in each.**  
      
    Most Exaltations will grant an additional specific Favored Ability
    (with its own free dot rating), bringing the total to **6.**

    1.  Use **9 dots** to increase Favored Abilities, with no single
        Ability being higher than **5**.

    2.  **6 dots** in *non-Favored* Abilities, with no single Ability
        raised higher than **3** during this phase.

6.  Choose Three Ability **Specialities,** in three favored Abilities.

7.  Choose a [**<u>Martial Arts Style</u>**](-3t4ra6h9kwgj). Martial
    Arts dictates how your character interacts during combat, ranging
    from animal styles to esoteric and strange supernatural styles.

8.  Gain 15 **Resources**, which may immediately be spent on Merits.
    During character creation, Obstruction rolls are ignored.

9.  Gain **3 Lesser Powers,** each in an Ability that is **Favored.**

1.  Spend **30 xp** as desired.

2.  Specify Equipment the character carries, considering their
    background. Unlike other systems, Exalted does not require an
    extensive list of what equipment or tools the Exalt has on their
    person---so long as it is reasonable for them to have an item, they
    are considered to be carrying it. Mundane armor and weapons are
    included.  
      
    All Weapons and Armor are grouped into categories, which grants
    general bonuses, such as a “Medium Sword”. This represents the
    general size and weight of the equipment, and whether it favors
    accuracy, damage, soak, or evasion.  
      
    When making attacks, the weapon also determines whether the
    character primarily uses Force (Strength) or Finesse (Dexterity) in
    their attacks.

3.  Once the character sheet has been finalized, calculate the **Derived
    Static Values. (**The provided character sheets will do this for you
    automatically).

4.  **General Static Values**

    1.  **Personal Motes  
        ***10 + (Essence)*  
        The amount of essence the Exalt may use for their various Powers
        that will *not* inflame their [<u>Anima
        Banner</u>](-wzcu53g1hrn6). Personal Motes regain slowly over
        time.

    2.  **Peripheral Motes  
        ***15 + (Essence) x2*  
        The amount of essence the Exalt may use for their various
        Powers. These motes *will* inflame their [<u>Anima
        Banner</u>](-wzcu53g1hrn6). Peripheral Motes are fully regained
        at the start of a new Scene.

    3.  **Guile  
        ***(Composure + Deception)/2*  
        The Measure of how secretive a character can be, used to hide
        their intentions, Intimacies, and reactions to Social Influence.

    4.  **Resolve  
        **(*Will + Integrity)/2*  
        How resistant a character is to Mental influence, and not being
        swayed to do actions they do not agree with.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Rounding</strong></p>
<p>For everything in Exalted, always round up to the nearest whole number.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

1.  **Combat Static Values**

    1.  **Initiative Bonus**  
        *(Cunning + Awareness)*  
        How quickly a character can react when a battle breaks out.

    2.  **Endurance:  
        ***10+(Stamina+Athletics+Physique)x2+(Essence) x3*  
        Endurance is the measure of how much beating and wear a
        character can take in a combat before collapsing.  
        As a note, Exalts naturally reinforce and steady themselves
        through the use of personal Essence. Mortals have a different
        Endurance Calculation as explained in the Antagonists section.

    3.  **DV**  
        *Greater of Evasion or Soak*  
        DV, or Defense Value, is the widely-applicable static defense
        value a character has against attacks.

    4.  **Evasion  
        ***(Dexterity + Athletics)/2 - (Armor Penalty)***  
        **The skill to avoid being hit, or turn hits away from vital
        organs. Attacks that ignore Evasion are called *undodgeable*,
        such as room-filling explosions and environmental damages (e.g.
        gravity).

    5.  **Soak**  
        *(Stamina + Physique)/2 + (Armor Modifier)*  
        Mitigation of attacks through training, armor, and force of
        body. Attacks that ignore Soak are called *unsoakable*, and
        contain things such as targetted or piercing damage.

    6.  **Base Damage:**  
        *(Strength + Essence)/2 + (Weapon Bonus)*  
        The base amount of attack an attack will do, regardless of
        chance or accuracy.

Advancement
-----------

Essence increases automatically depending on how much xp has accumulated
after Character Creation:

-   Essence 2: 25 xp

-   Essence 3: 50 xp

-   Essence 4: 100 xp

-   Essence 5: 200 xp

Player Characters in the same group should be kept at the same amount of
experience points, so that no single character gets significantly ahead
or behind others.

For each session, each player should be given **Five XP** and **Two
RES**, in addition to any Extra XP or RES they may have earned.

### Extra XP

The Storyteller may grant extra xp (+2 each) for roleplay. All player
characters receive this bonus--while one character may initiate it, it
is a shared and cooperative experience to bring that about.

-   Reaching a milestone in a player character’s personal story.

-   Suffering a defeat, or otherwise being impeded in their journeys.

-   A character falling to their Great Curse, which changes the course
    of the story in a non-insignificant manner.

### Gaining Resources

Resources should be sought out, and rewarded, based on the Player's
actions in the story. If they manage to acquire riches, or recruit
helpers to work, give them Resources to represent such actions.

Each individual **Keystone** *must* be intentionally sought out by the
player, and requires anywhere from a Scene to a full Story to acquire.

Each source of Resource should be added together when combined. For
example, by having access to the wealth and income of an entire city
(20) for a Season (50) would result in 70 RES.

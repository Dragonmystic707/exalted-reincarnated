Martial Arts
============

Martial Arts Styles are widely found across creation, with mortal,
God-blooded, Spirit, Demon, and Exalted practitioners alike. For mortal
practitioners, the motions of the Techniques are taught as a manner of
self discipline and motion, as they are often unable to press the Motes
required to activate its true effects.

Only one Martial Arts Style may be active at a time, and only Techniques
from that Style may be used during the same action. (i.e. Combos cannot
contain Techniques from multiple Styles..) Characters may switch their
Style and their Weapons at the start of their action as a free movement.

Techniques, unlike other Powers, **<u>must be bought in the order they
are presented in.</u>**

#### Form Weapons and Armor

As well, Martial Arts are restricted by what sorts of **weapons** and
**armor** the Stylist uses--after all, it would be all but impossible to
take the light, dancing maneuvers of Snake Style in Heavy Plate!

When using multiple styles, Stylist may start to use an array of
weapons. The **Switch Style** Secondary Action allows for this quick
changeover, so long as both weapons are within easy reach of the
character.

Alternatively, the Stylist may begin **creating new types of weapons**.
If they have two styles, one that calls for Thrown (disks), and the
other Melee (swords), they may decide that a *bladed chakram* is exactly
what they need.

### Weapons

\[\[Need to give a listing of example weapons types. These will be used
for Attack Ability Specialities…

**Melee**

-   Swords (All bladed-type weapons)

-   Clubs (All Blunt-type weapons)

-   Staff

-   Note how “Spears” is a Staff with a blade, that can also be thrown
    like a Javelin.

-   Throwing Disks (Chakram, shields)

The Stylist gains **+1 Evasion**. Anytime they Strike a character who
has not acted yet this round, they also gain **+2 Accuracy**.

#### Hand Needles

&lt;Dervish Dancer Style&gt;
----------------------------

**Performance, Melee  
**Unarmored, Swords

Long ago in the Great Southern Desert, voices of slaves cried out into
the winds of the sands in anguish.

Instead of carrying the voices afar as they had done so many times
before, the Inescapable Winds themselves listened to the anguish of the
mortals and became enraged, rushing down from the dunes in a glorious
storm.

In this moment, the truthes of the southern winds were imparted to these
mortals, and the slaves learned to harness the deadly winds to their
advantage.

The style formed around it, hidden in a beautiful and entrancing dance,
the grace and poise belying the strength and danger behind every move.
With it, the Slaves struck down their cruel master, and its
practitioners have vowed to come to all who are so oppressed,
inescapable in its message.

**Evasion. (**The target may choose to not Evade.) If successful, the
target ceases to exist for the next (Essence) actions, where they will

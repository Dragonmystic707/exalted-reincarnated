Preface
=======

**Exalted**, by **Onyx Path Publishing,** is a role-playing game
blending together high-action combat, social intrigue, and epic-scale
actions from demigod heroes.

The setting is full of rich lore, intricacies, and horrors that inspire
and captivate the mind, begging to be explored by a hero of grand scale.

However, the complexity and sheer size of the rules structure makes
playing the game a daunting task, even for experienced role-players.

**Exalted Reincarnated** is a fan-made work to rebuild and recreate
Exalted from the ground up to better match its rich Lore, Setting, and
Style.

Unofficial
----------

This is Fan-Made material. It is unofficial, and makes no claims of
ownership over Onyx Path Publishing materials.

You will need the official *Exalted* books for lore, setting and
reference material. *Exalted Reincarnated* makes assumptions based off
of Third Edition, but can be played with any of the editions.

Feedback
--------

This project is constantly evolving and changing. If you find problems
or want to simply share suggestions, please do so!

*Have fun!*

*Upon your brow lies the mark of a God: a brand of power that sets you
apart from mortals, given in a moment of transcendent glory--regardless
of your desire for the power.*

*With it, a vast wealth of supernatural power lies at your fingertips:
tasks that you once toiled and struggled against are easily swept aside.
Tasks that you deemed impossible suddenly a very real possibility.*

*Yet this land you reside in, this Creation, is filled with dangerous
creatures, monsters, Spirits and Gods that is now your responsibility to
deal with.*

*It is for you to decide what should be protected, what should be
furthered; what is ultimately right and wrong.*

*But you are not alone. There are other Exalts that wander the world,
each with their own agenda, ideas, and morality.*

*You are Chosen, you are Exalted*

Introduction
============

Exalted is a game where the heroes are demigods, fonts of power. That
which mortals toil and test against fall easily against the might of the
Exalts, and the Exalts now test their mettle against the monsters and
problems of the world: from the chaotic fae beasts which rip at the
edges of the world, to the horrid effects of greed and systemic
corruption that hides in the hearts of man.

More often than not, they will succeed in what they have set their mind
to-yet they must explore the consequences and repercussions of such
actions.

To play Exalted, there are a few core setting themes that should be
followed:

Actions are Momentous

The Player Character is the right person at the right time to change the
world--for better or for worse. This blessing and burden cannot be given
to another, and the Gods are restrained in their actions for reasons
ranging from arcane laws, to being involved in their own machinations,
to being too weak to do anything.

From the small, personal stories to world-shattering changes, the Exalt
stands at the center of it.

What is Done Cannot be Undone

Exaltations cannot be rescinded, the dead cannot return to life except
in a hollow mockery of what they once were, and the progress of time is
constantly moving forward. Exalts must face the consequences of all
their actions.

The Heroes are Flawed

Despite all of their powers and might, Exalts are still human and carry
with them their flaws--and this does not make them any less of a hero.

Dice
----

*Exalted Reincarnated* uses multiple ten-sided dice (d10s). It is
suggested to have fifteen dice (real or virtual). The dice will
represent digits between 1 and 10. (Some dice will have a 0, treat that
as a 10).

As well, having an allotment of various tokens-such as coins or poker
chips-can help keep track of values that change within a scene.

 Setting
-------

Creation trembles, poised at the turn of a new age. She strains as the
systems and rules which long held her together collapse around her. Her
population have become thrown into chaos, a time uncertain: a Time of
Tumult.,

The mighty Realm, whose reach expanded even out of the Blessed Isle, has
lost her Empress with no heir declared. Now, each Dragonblooded Clan
vies to claim the throne for their own, whether it be by politics or by
force--ignoring all else that goes on around them.

The Silver Pact, that loose association only tied together by their
hatred and resistance to the Realm, find their alliances crumbling.
Their stances mutate and shift just as their Lunar leaders do. Deep
rivalries and opposing systems clash as they turn their attention from
the faltering and collapsing Realm onto each other.

The Great City of Thorns has fallen, another wellspring of Death and her
servants bubbling up from the ever-present threat of the Underworld.

The silent and secretive Sidereals, those Seers from their hidden
places, watch, attempting to hold together what strands of Fate and
Reality they might, bickering on what Is and what Shall Be.

All the while, the minor powers seek to claim their own lands and hold
in this uncertain time.

In this time, the Sun has brought his Chosen back, those great heroes,
those terrible Mad Emperors.

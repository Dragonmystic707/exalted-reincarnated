General System
==============

Storyteller Timelines
---------------------

Rather than count the exact minutes and hours of effects, Exalted relies
on a more cinematic sense of time.

-   **Round**  
    Enough time for all characters present in the scene to perform at
    least one set of Actions.

-   **Scene**  
    Long enough to set out and accomplish a single, dedicated task.
    Combat from start to finish would be a scene, as would characters
    searching for clues in an old abandoned monastery. This typically
    spans minutes to hours.

-   **Session**  
    A single sitting of when Players begin and end roleplaying, spanning
    an entire night.

-   **Story**  
    Several sessions that form a full narrative arch: from establishing
    a threat to reaching the resolution.

-   **Chronicle**  
    A complete game, encompassing all the stories relevant to a set of
    characters.

Actions
-------

When a character encounters a situation where their success is
uncertain, the Storyteller should call for an Action Roll to determine
the outcome.

The Storyteller will ask for a combination of an Attribute and Ability
that is appropriate for the situation, and then determine an appropriate
Difficulty for the roll. The Player will then roll a number of Ten-Sided
Dice (d10’s) equal to the combined rating of the selected Attribute and
Ability—this combined number is called the Dice Pool. This will be
referred to as \[Att+Abi\] xd10’s.

Some powers and actions will call out specific Attribute + Ability
combinations, such as \[Wits + Awareness\], but others may simply
specify one or the other. For example, an “Awareness Roll” or a “Wits
Roll”. The two still require a full \[Att + Abi\] combination, they
simply allow the non-specified part to be determined by the Storyteller.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Only Roll if the Result is Unknown</strong></p>
<p>If the outcome of an action is already known beforehand (either as a failure or a success), there is no need for a roll—simply declare what happens and continue on with the story.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Successes

After rolling their Dice Pool, the player needs to count the number of
dice that are showing digits equal or greater than the Target Number of
(7). Examine the results of six rolled dice:

**1, 4, 4, 7, 8, 8**

The values of 7, 8, and 8 are greater than or equal to (7), so they are
each counted as a success, meaning this particular roll would result in
3 Successes.

### Double 10’s

A die that shows 10 is counted as two successes, rather than one. If the
roll had instead been:

**1, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10**

7 and 8 would be counted once, and 10 counted twice, making 4 successes
on the roll.

### Difficulty

*Before a roll is performed*, the Storyteller should determine the
**Difficulty** of the roll—the number of successes that the roll must
match or exceed for the action to be considered a success.

-   **Difficulty 1 (Easy)  
    **This task is expected to be passed by a skilled mortal, but there
    is still a reasonable risk of failing.

-   **Difficulty 3 (Typical)**- This task is challenging to a mere
    mortal, but an Exalted Hero is more than likely going to pass it.
    Picking a lock, calming an irate guardsman, or basic first aid would
    fall under this category.

-   **Difficulty 5** **(Difficult)**- Tasks which are daunting fall in
    this category—climbing a sheer cliff in winds, charming a staunch
    Dynast with sweet words, or avoiding the bite of a venomous beast.

-   **Difficulty 7 (Challenging)**- Tasks which should be
    near-impossible for any mortal. Such as noticing things in pitch
    darkness, or landing on a precise spot hundreds of feet below.

-   **Difficulty 9 (Impossible)**- Tasks a mortal could not possibly do,
    no matter the circumstances. Running straight up a building, leaping
    across a chasm unassisted, or keeping a patient alive without a
    heart for hours at a time with their bare hands.

<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Failing Forward</strong></p>
<p>In a high-powered setting such as Exalted, properly handling it is important, and is in a way more difficult than a success, as it puts the burden of keeping the story moving on you, the Storyteller. Remember: you are not there to <em>punish</em> the players for daring to take an action, only to provide boundaries and restrictions.<br />
<br />
There are a few general paths to take:</p>
<p>1. A simple failure—the character don’t do the action, the story continues. Typically you pick this path when the players already know of different paths they may take. Sometimes letting your players step back and reanalyze their approach is</p>
<p>2. Only an important part fails—the character does squeak by on what they intended, but at a great cost. They open the doors, but only enough for one person to slip by or by causing a great commotion. Choose this path if halting the action would kill all momentum of the session.</p>
<p>3. “No, but...”—If players have heavily invested in an action, and it just doesn’t work out, don’t give them <em>nothing</em>. Sure, they failed at the task they were intending, but another pathway opens. Maybe they failed to convince the Queen of their plight, but the Prince overheard and wishes to speak to them. Be judicious of choosing this option, as overuse may make your game feel consequence-free.</p></td>

Action types
------------

Most rolls are simple: the Player dictates what they are intending to
do, and the Storyteller tells them which (Attribute + Ability) to roll,
and how much the difficulty will be. While this is overwhelmingly the
most common dice setup, there are a few alternate rolls that can be
called for.

### Assisting

A player may assist another character, granting them +2 dice. The
receiving character may only accept one Assist per roll. The act of
Assisting typically consumes the character’s action.

### Contested Actions

Certain actions are contested between abilities of two or more
characters, rather than a simple difficulty.

In this case, all characters simply roll their appropriate Dice Pool,
and compare who got the highest number of Successes.

#### Taking the Average

To speed things along, the Storyteller is encouraged to take the
*average* number, rounded down, of the NPC’s dice pool. If they have 4-5
dice, simply state that they get got 2 successes and move on.

The exception to this guidance are important characters, such as rivals
or foes of great challenge.

> There are two characters in the scene: a guard and a thief. The guard is keeping watch, and the thief is attempting to sneak past them. The dice pool for the player-controlled thief would be Dexterity + Stealth.
> 
> Since this is a NPC, and there are no dice-affecting powers active, the storyteller simply takes the average: (Wits + Awareness)/2, which turns out to be 3. Should the thief match or surpass that difficulty, they successfully sneak past.

### Retrying Rolls

Once a roll has been decided, a Player cannot simply try the action
again—it is assumed that the character has already approached the issue
from multiple different angles before truly failing. For example, their
failed barter included multiple tiers of money that they were willing to
part with.

Only through powers like a Charm, or by a dramatic change of the scene
is a re-roll allowed—for example, the marketplace erupting in a great
conflict, convincing the merchant that they need to sell and leave as
quickly as possible.

### Recurring Rolls

The Exalted will suffer—and inflict—many sorts of ailments and statuses
ranging from toxins and diseases to more esoteric effects such as curses
and mental Influence.

The onset of the status is handled as normal—if resisting a toxin, it
would simply be a (Stamina + Physique) roll against the Difficulty of
the Toxin. On a success, they simply would not be poisoned.

On failing, they are now subject to the status effect, and now must
either wait for the status to run its course, or take *active*,
*considered* effort to try and cure themselves. Each time they take such
an action, they are allowed to roll to resist again and potentially
remove the effect. Each attempt must be some different methodology.

Any mundane statuses, even at their worst, will naturally be purged from
an Exalt if they are given a full day of rest.

Excellencies
------------

Exalts, however, aren’t restricted to simply *accepting* the roll that
is given to them. When they need to, they may activate their
Exalt-specific Excellency to push their roll further than they thought
they could.

For example, a Solar will be able to add their Ability Ranks as a number
of Successes to their roll, turning what is a certain failure into a
success.

However, this does not come without a cost. The character is straining
themselves beyond their mortal bonds, and so will gain a point of
[Limit](/System/General_System/#limit), as well as inflame their [Anima Banner](/System/General_System/#anima-banner)
one step above the natural level for the remainder of the Scene—e.g. the
first use of the scene will set the anima banner to the *Glowing* step.

Advantages and Disadvantages
----------------------------

The difficulty of an action can be modified by various conditions,
whether it be environmental, helpful, or antagonistic. These should be
provided by the Storyteller as deemed appropriate.

By default, Advantages and Disadvantages are written in terms of
**dice** available for the character to roll: (+2/-2 dice). Since this
is the default, the “dice” moniker is often dropped—if a power ever
simply says “+2”, it means to dice.

Whenever a Modifier affects a static value, such as Resolve or
Difficulty, you should **take the average**, rounding up. +2 dice is +1
to Resolve, for example. Some powers will directly reference Static
Value or Difficulty modifiers, instead of dice.

### Assigning Modifiers

Modifiers can be granted from any source, such as any powers, the
environment, or even the mental condition of the character taking the
action.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><blockquote>
<p><strong>Advantage/Disadvantage</strong></p>
</blockquote></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p><strong>Dice</strong></p>

<p><strong>Difficulty</strong></p>

<tr class="odd">

</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>±6</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>±3</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Any **Modifier** should be something significant to the scene—something
that would perturb even an Exalt. A light rain, while thematic, would
not count as a disadvantage—simply scenery and aesthetic. Only when
there are levels of pummeling rain (-2), or even a raging Typhoon (-4).

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Natural Modifiers and Difficulty</p>
<p>Remember that Difficulty has its own inbuilt assumptions—many difficulties are set because they are a particular “base” level of challenge with a specific disadvantage: e.g. picking a difficult lock (3) vs. picking a difficult lock while blindfolded in a hurricane (9).</p>
<p>If a character uses a charm or power to dismiss part of that difficulty—e.g. removing all impairments caused by weather—it is the same as granting them an equivalent Advantage!</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Stunting
--------

The setting of *Exalted* encourages wild, ambitious, and perhaps
dangerous actions of the characters. When a player describes their
character doing their action in a fun and creative way, the Storyteller
should reward them. If the action described is reasonable and adds to
the Scene, the Storyteller should simply let the Player dictate what
happens without a roll—if a (non-clumsy) character swings from a
chandelier in order to drop down on top of an enemy, don’t slow that
down with an Athletics roll.

If a roll is still required, the Storyteller should grant +2 Dice (or +1
to a Defense) for the action being performed—a reward and encouragement
to others to engage with the setting and scenery. That said, Stunts
should be kept short and sweet to keep the momentum of the game moving
forward.

Stunts should operate off of the “Rule of Cool,” and may bend the rules
a bit, both of reality and the game—such as falling great distances to
land perfectly in a pose.

Essence
-------

Essence is the fundamental energy that flows through the world, all
creatures, and mortals—an energy that Exalts are naturally able to wield
to their advantage. A character’s Essence Rating is a measure of how in
tune the character is with the flows of energy through and surrounding
them. Much like an Attribute, it ranges between 1 and 5 for Exalts.
Mortals have a Rating of 0.

The Rating of Essence cannot be directly trained. Instead, it only
increases in rating as the character gains xp.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>The Uniqueness of Player Characters</p>
<p>Player Characters are unusual in the sheer speed and heights they can reach with Essence. The constant stress and challenge of adventure accelerates the gain of Essence far beyond what is normal in the world of Exalted.</p>
<p>Non-Player Characters do not follow the same rapid gain of Essence that Player Characters do, and are often constrained and capped, limiting what Essence Rating they can reach based on their circumstances.</p>
<p>Dragonblooded, for example, would find it takes a lifetime to even reach Essence 3—only the eldest of their kind would have access to Greater Charms.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Motes

Essence expenditure is measured in *Motes*. When activating a Power that
requires motes of Essence the exalt will **first** drain from their
Personal Mote pool, and once that is exhausted they will drain from
their Peripheral Mote Pool.

-   **Personal Motes** are intrinsic to the character. Expenditure of
    these motes are subtle and do not agitate their anima banner. This
    pool replenishes at a rate of 1 mote per hour of rest, or fully
    after a full night’s rest.

-   **Peripheral Motes** are the character’s ability to manipulate the
    world immediately surrounding them, channeling it to their will.
    Using these motes will *expose their anima banner*. This pool is
    completely refreshed at the *beginning of a new Scene.*

Anima Banner
------------

Exalts are brimming with energy, their souls suffused with the crackling
energy. Whenever they wish, they may choose to inflame this energy,
crackling their soul outward in various levels from a soft glow around
their body to a full towering bonfire of personal iconography and
symbols deeply personal to the character.

Whenever they *intentionally* flare their Anima, they may also quickly
retreat it back into their soul. (Both showing and recalling the anima
is considered a Reflexive Action.

However, when a character uses Peripheral Motes, the Anima Banner will
*uncontrollably* start to spill out, and the Exalt cannot do anything
but wait for time to pass before they can recall it back into their
soul.

### Anima Steps

The anima gradually increases as the peripheral mote pool is depleted,
but there are specific notable steps along the way:

-   **(10) Dim**  
    This is considered the **default** or **natural** state of the
    anima. It is invisible to all natural senses, but may be seen by
    those that can peek into the Spirit Realm.

-   **(5) Glowing  
    **A thin outline of the anima appears around the character, with the
    respective Caste Mark appearing on their brow. Characters standing
    face to face will most likely notice it, but may not be able to make
    out the exact iconography.

\(3\) Burning  
Essence burns and sheds from the Exalts body, much like the burning of a
fire. The Caste Mark is unmistakable to any close-by.

-   **(1) Bonfire  
    **A grand display of solidified Essence wraps around the body,
    shining its personal iconography to all of those in the scene.

Once the first peripheral mote is spent, those looking at the Exalt will
be able to notice the anima banner—the Difficulty equal to how many
motes are left in the peripheral pool. Those standing face-to-face or
directly engaged with the Exalt should have an advantage to notice the
spiritual flame.

The Anima Flare should dissipate by the start of a new Scene, or at a
rate of 15 minutes per Step.

The Great Curse
---------------

Exaltation is a great and wondrous blessing from the Gods, but with it
comes a great and terrible Curse. Perhaps, as the ancient and lost
stories speak, the slain Enemies of the Gods lay this Curse upon their
servants as a last, spiteful word in their dying breath. Or perhaps it
is simply inalienable nature of man, exemplified and given root in
power.

Regardless of its source, every Exalt carries with them the Great Curse,
an aggrandized character flaw that can interrupt and sabotage a
character’s well meaning in spite of their better nature.

Each individual Exaltation book details their Great Curse, but it is
important to know that these are all *suggestions*. So long as a
character has a flaw that affects their decision, it is an acceptable
Great Curse.

For Example:

-   **Solars** suffer from their own Ego. They are those that tirelessly
    seek greatness and perfection, and may find others or even
    themselves not up to the standards they desire.

-   **Lunars** suffer from being trapped between worlds and are
    conflicted by the unknown. Are they man or beast? A part of society
    or apart from it? Their form is constantly shifting, so who are they
    really?

-   **Abyssals** have a portion of their self consumed by the void:
    something that is lost and that can never be reclaimed. It may be
    their name and relations; their lost vitality; a loss of emotion and
    feeling.

### Limit

The stress and wear of an Exalt’s life will build and press upon them,
eventually driving them to a breaking point. This is represented by
**Limit Points**.

Ranging from 0-10, Limit Points represent how strained the Exalt is—how
much wear and tear their psyche and soul is under.

If the character reaches 10 Limit, or if they fail their Limit Check,
the character will enter into a Limit Break.

### Gaining Limit

A character gains Limit by either pushing their character with their
Excellency, or by encountering an event which the Player has written as
particularly aggravating to their flaw.

&lt;&lt;TODO&gt;&gt;

Whenever a character gains limit, they also must make a roll as though
they had encountered their Limit Trigger.

An Intimacy being plausibly threatened is a loose term ultimately up to
the interpretation of the Player, but there are a few guidelines,
depending on the type of Intimacy:

-   Purposefully acting against it.

-   Being tricked, and realizing the harm that has been caused.

-   The target being significantly hurt.

-   Being forced to question core aspects of the Intimacy.

A character does not gain more than 1 Limit per scene from their
Intimacies being in danger. Limit gained from Pushing the Roll does not
count for this restriction.

> A Dragonblooded Monk, through a complicated turn of events, is forced to work alongside Anathema. Being a true believer of the Immaculate Order, they would gain limit:

-   > On the choice to work with the Anathema.

-   > Whenever their compatriots does something that is “evil.”

-   > On finding evidence that the Immaculate Order and the concept of Anathema is not as clear cut as previously believed.
> 
> It’s important to note that the Monk would not have to gain limit every single day, but rather on every “event” that happens aggravating their Intimacy.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>The Calming Effect of Time</strong></p>
<p>Limit resets after a Limit Break, which is the main . However, long spans of rest, meditation, and peace may ease the Exalt down from their stressed life.</p>
<p>So long as the time breaks are particularly restful, the Exalt may lose 1 Limit per week.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Limit Triggers

When detailing out their Great Curse, the Player will also need to
decide what sort of events will **inflame** their Great Curse. This is
called the **Limit Trigger.**

A compassionate character might balk whenever they see a wanton,
senseless act of cruelty upon another—such as a slave being whipped.
Another might be the sense of failure and dejection when a plan spirals
out of control.

A Limit Trigger is deeply tied to a character’s Intimacy being
threatened—often the character will gain Limit at the same time. But the
Limit Trigger is a *specified*, written aspect of the character, planned
before time, and deeply tied to the character—even more-so than their
normal Intimacies.

If a character has a Defining Intimacy, it is almost certainly an aspect
of that.

When this event occurs (and the character has at least 2 Limit,) the
Player must roll a 1d10. If the die roll matches or exceeds their
current Limit, the Character is able to control their emotions for the
remainder of the scene.

However, if the roll is **under** the current Limit, the Character
enters a **Limit Break**.

### Limit Break

When a character **Limit Breaks,** they lose all perspective on anything
that does not align with their **Great Curse** and will make active and
considered effort to fulfill it, regardless of the consequences.

A character Limit Breaking does not lose their faculties, nor do they
forget their Intimacies—but those are simply *secondary* to their Great
Curse. Often they will use convoluted and strange reasoning to justify
their actions.

A Limit Break lasts for an entire scene. Only performing a grave offense
against their own deeply-held Intimacies would be enough to snap the
character out of their actions prematurely.

At the end of a Limit Break, reset Limit to 0.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Ticking Time Bomb</strong></p>
<p>There will be occasions when a character enters Limit Break, but turning it into a Limit Break Scene just doesn’t fit—it occurred during a lighthearted scene, or when the Exalt is in the middle of nowhere on their own, or the scene was just wrapping up.</p>
<p>If this occurs, with both the Storyteller and Player in agreement, the Character can postpone the Limit Break to a more appropriate scene—just don’t wait <em>too</em> long.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Strifes
-------

The world of Creation will push even the mighty Exalted to the brink,
and in those moments of desperation, forcing them to delve into reserves
they did not know they had. This moment is called a **Strife**.

Players are restricted to keeping no more than **5 Strife Points** at a
time. If Strife is gained above this limit, it must immediately be spent
in the Scene or be lost.

### Using Strife

#### Strife Expression

Each Exalt and their Caste, has a unique **Expression** that can boost
their Dice rolls.

For example, Solars may double a favored dice, while Sidereals
manipulate what the Target Number of a roll will be.

Each Exalt’s particular Strife Expression is detailed in their
respective book.

#### Introduce a Fact

The Player is allowed to introduce a Fact about the setting, detailing
something that is (and always has been) true in the world of Creation.

This Fact must be internally consistent with what has already been shown
to be true about the world. As well, the Storyteller has a right to veto
this introduced Fact (in which the Strife Point is returned), but is
encouraged to try to make the new Fact work.

The Fact should be related to the Player’s character in some way,
drawing from their Favored Abilities, Specialties, backstory, or Merits
in some way. Introducing the Fact that there is ancient order of
warriors known to be in the general area would make sense for a Player
whose character is a swordsman, but not one whose character is a
sorcerer, for example.

#### *Charm-like Effect*

In addition to their Exalt and Caste Strife Expressions, all players may
use a strife point to create a charm-like effect, which will turn the
scene in their favor. Inspiration can be drawn from any existing
non-Greater charm, or it can be custom tailored for the situation.

When using a Strife, the action should simply happen without a roll. So
long as a character *should* be able to do something, and it is *cool*
for them to do so, it *does.* In this way, it can be thought of as a
more powerful Stunt.

The only exception being if it *directly* targets an Exalt-level
antagonist, in which case a contested roll may be used.

### Strife Limitations

There are a few guiding restrictions to keep in mind with Strifes,
similar to a Stunt:

-   Other character’s actions cannot be dictated: only those under
    control of the Player’s.

-   The Action cannot *directly* solve the scene; it can only assist and
    guide it.

-   The Action should flow naturally from the character—a Solar cannot
    suddenly shapeshift, for example.

##### Example 1

> The Archer turns from the Dragonblood threatening her and focusing her essence into a point on their arrow. With a sharp hiss of air, she lets it loose into the nearest mountain, watching as the arrow explodes in an impressive show of Anima. The mountain rumbles as the snow dislodges, causing the newly-fallen snow to groan, rumble, and then start cascading into a deadly avalanche which rushes into the passage, sealing it and cutting off the dynasts reinforcements.

“I’m going to use my archery to cause an avalanche”. This example
accomplishes two dramatic things: it changes the environment, but
ultimately it is about stopping the Antagonist’s time constraint on
their battle. It assists the Player and their scene, but does not solve
the pressing issue—the fight with the Dragonblooded.

##### Example 2

> The Sorcerer looks apprehensive at his map. The desert has become inhospitable to their travels, and the rations for their mortal followers slim—if a solution isn’t found, they will arrive exhausted, or be forced to take a detour through the Guild’s controlled areas. His brown furrows, then suddenly shoots up: “Turn the caravan west, I see a Dragonline I can tap for water!”

“He’s going to use Sorcery to pull up water from the ground.” In this
situation, the problem being addressed is exhaustion or avoiding a bad
decision—preventing a negative.

##### Example 3

> The Crafter analyzes the complex door in front of them, which is blocking their way, the code shifting and twisting before their eyes. “I can simply craft a new key to the puzzle. Hold on for a moment.”

“The door is locked? I can just open it with crafting.” Is **bad**
because the main objective of this scene is to get past the door
blocking their path. In a different scene where the door was not the
main obstacle, this *might* be acceptable. Instead, an alteration can be
suggested:

>  The Crafter analyzes the shifting patterns of the door, then with a swift kick, lodges one of the panels shut, stopping the patterns from constantly moving. “There, that should be easier to read now.”

“The puzzle glyphs are moving? I’m going to jam them down so it lowers
the difficulty.”

### Gaining Strife

Strife may be gained through two ways: **Botches** and **Scene
Complications**.

[<u>Botches</u>](botching) are Player-driven choices to drive their
character’s failure into a *magnificent* failure—a low so that they may
later rise to even greater heights.

#### Complications

A **Complication** is a tool for the Storyteller to inject danger,
twists, and story momentum into the Story—*without Player Characters
being able to meaningfully react.* (The Characters will almost certainly
react, but the outcome is a forgone conclusion.)

In other words, while Players can spend Strife to Turn the Scene in
their *favor*, Storytellers can give Strife to Turn the Scene *against*
the Players—not simply describe challenges or consequences of actions.

The Storyteller gifts a Strife Point to all Players who are affected by
this event—and this single Strife Point guarantees the *outcome* of the
event in the Scene, no matter how many attempts are made.

**Examples:**

-   An Antagonist group escapes after their defeat in a fight, slipping
    the bonds or escaping pursuit.

The main source of Strife is gained by players choosing to **Botch**
their rolls.

Another source is being gifted a point by the Storyteller in exchange
for letting certain events unfold as described—in spite of Player
actions. For example, after a combat scene with a recurring antagonist,
the Storyteller would grant a Strife point to allow the antagonist to
escape without a (successful) pursuit, so they can lick their wounds and
try again.

Elsewhere and Equipment
-----------------------

The mechanisms of reality are flawed. Items, particularly those not paid
attention to, have a tendency to reappear and move to alternate
locations. Mortals will often attribute this forgetfulness, or not
recognize the incongruity at all, when in reality it is the tireless
motions of the Loom taking shortcuts.

Exalts, long ago, learned how to quietly and easily exploit this—simply
though sleight of hand, they can store their physical items in places
and not feel the weight nor brunt of the equipment. It is not unusual
for an Exalt to suddenly pull out a large daiklaive from little more
than a handbag’s opening.

Depositing or retrieving equipment from Elsewhere takes an entire
Action.

Sidereals have labeled this flaw as “Elsewhere,” since the items are
neither *here* nor *there*, but simply somewhere…else. Certainly it is
something that needs to be fixed. Eventually. Preferably by someone
else.

Elsewhere is not all-powerful. The Exalt must reasonably be able to
carry the items in the first place, and it must not be something that
has a particularly close and important tie to reality. For example:
living creatures cannot be kept in Elsewhere, as their mind and soul has
far too great of self-awareness to be forgotten by reality.

As well, while time does not affect items *inside* of Elsewhere, the
moment it is pulled out reality will quickly reassert itself. Food would
rot within seconds, and we iron rust within a blink of an eye.

Items stored in Elsewhere of a dead Exalt will eventually reassert
themselves into reality—often by finding themselves in nearby containers
that may not have existed until needed for this precise purpose.

Magnitudes
----------

*Exalted* is styled in more of a cinematic, broad-sweeping style game
rather than a precise simulation war-game. Instead of detailing out
every person, time frame, or area, it will instead deal with measures of
*magnitude.*

Some Powers will declare an increase (or decrease) in a *magnitude*.
Those magnitude definitions are as follows:

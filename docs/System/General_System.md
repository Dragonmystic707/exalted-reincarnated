Action Rolls
------------

When a character encounters a situation where their success is
uncertain, the Storyteller should call for an Action Roll to determine
the outcome.

The Storyteller will ask for a combination of an Attribute and Ability
that is appropriate for the situation, and then determine an appropriate
Difficulty for the roll.

The Player will then roll a number of Ten-Sided Dice (d10’s) equal to
the combined rating of the selected Attribute and Ability—this combined
number is called the Dice Pool.

This will be referred to as \[Att+Abi\] xd10’s.

Some powers and actions will call out specific Attribute + Ability
combinations, such as \[Wits + Awareness\], but others may simply
specify one or the other. For example, an “Awareness Roll” or a “Wits
Roll”. The two still require a full \[Att + Abi\] combination, they
simply allow the non-specified part to be determined by the Storyteller.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Only roll if the Result is unknown</strong></p>
<p>If the outcome of an action is already known beforehand (either as a failure or a success), there is no need for a roll—simply declare what happens and continue on with the story.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Successes

After rolling their Dice Pool, the player needs to count the number of
dice that are showing digits equal or greater than the Target Number of
(7). Examine the results of six rolled dice:

**1, 4, 4, 7, 8, 8**

The values of 7, 8, and 8 are greater than or equal to (7), so they are
each counted as a success, meaning this particular roll would result in
3 Successes.

### Double 10’s

A die that shows 10 is counted as two successes, rather than one. If the
roll had instead been:

**1, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10**

7 and 8 would be counted once, and 10 counted twice, making 4 successes
on the roll.

### Difficulty

*Before a roll is performed*, the Storyteller should determine the
**Difficulty** of the roll—the number of successes that the roll must
match or exceed for the action to be considered a success.

-   **Difficulty 1 (Easy)**- This task is expected to be passed by a
    skilled mortal, but there is still a reasonable risk of failing.

-   **Difficulty 3 (Typical)**- This task is challenging to a mere
    mortal, but a hero is expected to pass it. Picking a lock, calming
    an irate guardsman, or basic first aid would fall under this
    category.

-   **Difficulty 5** **(Difficult)**- Tasks which are daunting fall in
    this category—climbing a sheer cliff in winds, charming a staunch
    Dynast with sweet words, or avoiding the bite of a venomous beast.

-   **Difficulty 7 (Challenging)**- Tasks which should be
    near-impossible for any mortal. Such as noticing things in pitch
    darkness, or landing on a precise spot hundreds of feet below.

-   **Difficulty 9 (Impossible)**- Tasks a mortal could not possibly do,
    no matter the circumstances. Running straight up a building, leaping
    across a chasm unassisted, or keeping a patient alive without a
    heart for hours at a time with their bare hands.

### Threshold Successes

Some rolls are not as much concerned with *whether* the character
succeeds, but *by how much*. This is simply the difference between the
total Number of Successes rolled, and the Difficulty.

If a Player rolled Four (4) Successes on a Difficulty One (1) task, they
would then have Three (3) Threshold Successes.

### Contested Actions

Certain actions are contested between abilities of two or more
characters, rather than a simple difficulty.

In this case, all characters simply roll their appropriate Dice Pool,
and compare who got the highest number of Successes.

#### Taking the Average

The Storyteller should take the average number of successes for
non-player characters as ½ their Dice pool, which is their \[Att +
Ability +/- Modifiers\]

> There are two characters in the scene: a guard and a thief. The guard is keeping watch, and the thief is attempting to sneak past them. The dice pool for the player-controlled thief would be Dexterity + Stealth.
> 
> Since this is a NPC, and there are no dice-affecting powers active, the storyteller simply takes the average: (Wits + Awareness)/2. Should the thief match or surpass that number, they successfully sneak past. Should they not, the guard discovers them.

Push the Roll
-------------

Exalts can push themselves past their mortal limits and achieve the
impossible—but it often comes at a price.

After the Player rolls and all effects finalized, the Player may choose
to **Push their Roll** In exchange, they gain **+2 successes** to a
roll, or **+1** **Defense,** at the expense of **Taking a Drawback**.

**Note:** Drawbacks cannot be taken for Luck Rolls, Limit Break, Join
Battle or anything else that uses a 1d10 as its roll.

Drawbacks
---------

A Drawback can be any sort of action that the Storyteller deems to be a
proper **Price to Pay** for succeeding (or exceeding) their roll.

The following are a list of Examples, but should not be treated as
exhaustive or exclusive:

### Gain Limit

*Immediately Limit Break at 10.*

The character gains 1 point of [<u>Limit</u>](/System/General_System/#limit), representing the
spiritual stress required to do the task.

### Wound/Exhaustion

*Cannot take more than (-5) total Wounds/Exhaustions at a time.*

The strain from pushing beyond their natural constraints causes the
character to become injured or exhausted.

For the remainder of the scene, and then until the character can take an
uninterrupted, restful night’s sleep, the character suffers (-1) dice to
any roll made with the Attribute Category (Physical, Social, or Mental)
they used on this roll.

This does not affect Static Values such as Resolve.

### The Scene Turns Sour

*This Drawback may only be taken once per scene.*

After this action, the scene becomes negative, if not mildly hostile,
towards the character. Perhaps they offended a vital character with
their action, or they accidentally gave a secret up to the Antagonist
that they can use.

Botching
--------

If a character fails their action, they may choose to *worsen* their
failure dramatically, as represented by taking a Drawback. In exchange,
they will gain a [**<u>Strife Point</u>**](/System/General_System/#strifes).

If at all possible, the Player should try to include their **Great
Curse** as reasoning for this Botch. Perhaps a prideful character could
not help but reveal a secret in their boasting; a compassionate one
unable to hide their disgust at conditions of the city when talking to
an official.

Advantages and Disadvantages
----------------------------

The difficulty of an action can be modified by various conditions,
whether it be environmental, helpful, or antagonistic. As generic term,
these are called **Dice Modifiers**, but will more often is designated
specifically as either an **Advantage** or as a **Disadvantage,**
depending on if it helps the character or impedes them.

By default, Advantages and disadvantages are written in terms of
**dice** available for the character to roll: (+2, -2 dice). Since this
is the default, the “dice” moniker is often dropped—if a power ever
simply says “+2”, it means to dice.

Whenever a Modifier affects a static value, such as Resolve or
Difficulty, you should **take the average**, rounding up. +2 dice is +1
to Resolve, for example. Some powers will directly reference Static
Value or Difficulty modifiers, instead of dice.

### Assigning Modifiers

Modifiers can be granted from any source, such as any powers, the
environment, or even the mental condition of the character taking the
action.

Any **Modifier** should be something significant to the scene—something
that would perturb even an Exalt. A light rain, while thematic, would
not count as a disadvantage. Only when there are levels of pummeling
rain (-2), or even a raging Typhoon (-4).

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Natural Modifiers and Difficulty</strong></p>
<p>Difficulty, in its most basic sense, is a measure of “Base difficulty + all Disadvantages”. This can often be forgotten when choosing a Difficulty for a task, or when countering specific modifiers.</p>
<p>If a player removes the “visual impairment” modifier from a Difficulty 7 task, it is up to the Storyteller to decide how much of the Difficulty for the task was a result of “visual impairment”, and how much is simply the base difficulty of the task.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Stunting
--------

The setting of *Exalted* encourages wild, ambitious, and perhaps
dangerous actions of the characters. When a player describes their
character doing a “cool” action, the Storyteller should reward them.

When a player performs a stunt, they get **+2 Dice** for their action,
and are given more lenience on what actions they are able to perform.

The guiding philosophy of stunts is the “Rule of Cool.” If the stated
action is “cool” and enhances an existing action, it should both be
allowed and encouraged—even if it is not technically allowed.

There are limits to Stunting. A Player cannot dictate the actions or
emotions of characters, for example, and the Storyteller reserves the
right to reject or alter the stated effects of the stunt as needed.

### Assisting

A player may assist another character, granting them +2 dice. The
receiving character may only accept one Assist per roll.

The Receiving Player may both accept an Assist, as well as stunt their
own action.

Assisting is considered a Simple Action.

Essence
-------

Essence is the fundamental energy that flows through the world, all
creatures, and mortals. Exalts are able to guide their own Essence flows
to create powerful effects upon the world, called Charms.

A character’s Essence Rating is a measure of how in tune the character
is with the flows of energy through and surrounding them. Much like an
Attribute, it ranges between One and Five for Exalts. (Mortals have a
Rating of Zero.)

The Rating of Essence cannot be directly trained. Instead, it only
increases in rating as the character gains xp.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>The Uniqueness of Player Characters</strong></p>
<p>Player Characters are unusual in the sheer speed and heights they can reach with Essence. The constant stress and challenge of adventure accelerates the gain of Essence far beyond what is normal in the world of Exalted.</p>
<p>Non-Player Characters do not follow the same rapid gain of Essence that Player Characters do, and are often constrained and capped, limiting what Essence Rating they can reach based on their circumstances.</p>
<p>Dragonblooded, for example, would find it takes a lifetime to even reach Essence 3—only the eldest of their kind would have access to Major Charms.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Motes

Essence expenditure is measured in *Motes*. When activating a Power that
requires motes of Essence the exalt will **first** drain from their
Personal Mote pool, and once that is exhausted they will drain from
their Peripheral Mote Pool.

-   **Personal Motes** are intrinsic to the character. Expenditure of
    these motes are subtle and do not agitate their anima banner.

    -   Refreshed after a full night’s rest.

-   **Peripheral Motes** are the character’s ability to manipulate the
    world immediately surrounding them, channeling it to their will.
    Using these motes will **expose their anima banner**.

    -   Refreshed at the beginning of a new Scene.

#### Antagonistic Locations

There are certain locations that are either devoid of Essence, such as
the **Underworld**, or are filled with antagonistic Essence that cannot
be easily drawn inward, like **The Wyld**.

In these locations, all characters will suffer a Penalty to their
Peripheral Mote pool, lowering their capacity.

Anima Banner
------------

Exalts are brimming with energy, their souls suffused with the crackling
energy.

Whenever a character uses **Peripheral Motes**, this energy crackles to
life, and their very soul starts to show to the world in the form of the
**Anima Banner**—a display of light that starts as a soft glow and
eventually escalates to a towering bonfire of personal iconography and
symbols deeply personal to the character.

As the Peripheral Pool is depleted, the Anima banner will automatically
and reflexively ignite.

-   **(0m) Dim** The natural state of the anima. It is invisible to all
    natural senses, but may be seen by those that can peek into the
    Spirit Realm.

-   **(1-5m) Glowing** A thin outline of the anima appears around the
    character, with the respective Caste Mark appearing on their brow.
    Characters may still disguise and hide their anima through mundane
    means, such as clothes.

-   **(6-10m) Burning** Essence burns and sheds from the Exalts body,
    much like the burning of a fire. Hiding the anima at this level is
    impossible through mundane means.

-   **(11m+) Bonfire** A grand display of solidified Essence wraps
    around the body, shining its personal iconography to all of those in
    the scene.

Anima Flare takes 15 minutes to naturally abate and decrease in rating,
so long that no action inflames them again. Often, this means that the
Burning and Bonfire Levels will be active for an entire scene.

Exalts may choose to intentionally increase their anima to any desired
level by spending One Mote (as a Reflexive Action). This lasts until the
Exalt chooses to dismiss it where it immediately dissipates, unlike the
natural Anima Flare.

The Great Curse
---------------

Exaltation is a great and wondrous blessing from the Gods, but with it
comes a great and terrible Curse. Perhaps, as the ancient and lost
stories speak, the slain Enemies of the Gods lay this Curse upon their
servants as a last, spiteful word in their dying breath. Or perhaps it
is simply inalienable nature of man, exemplified and given root in
power.

Regardless of its source, every Exalt carries with them the Great Curse,
an aggrandized character flaw that can interrupt and sabotage a
character’s well meaning in spite of their better nature.

Each individual Exaltation book details their Great Curse, but it is
important to know that these are all *suggestions*. So long as a
character has a flaw that affects their decision, it is an acceptable
Great Curse.

For Example:

-   **Solars** suffer from their own Ego. They are those that tirelessly
    seek greatness and perfection, and may find others or even
    themselves not up to the standards they desire.

-   **Lunars** suffer from being trapped between worlds and are
    conflicted by the unknown. Are they man or beast? A part of society
    or apart from it? Their form is constantly shifting, so who are they
    really?

-   **Abyssals** have a portion of their self consumed by the void:
    something that is lost and that can never be reclaimed. It may be
    their name and relations; their lost vitality; a loss of emotion and
    feeling.

### Limit

The stress and wear of an Exalt’s life will build and press upon them,
eventually driving them to a breaking point. This is represented by
**Limit Points**.

Ranging from 0-10, **Limit Points** represent how strained the Exalt
is—how much wear and tear their psyche and soul is under.

If the character reaches **10 Limit**, or if they fail on their **Limit
Trigger**, the character will enter into a **Limit Break.**

### Gaining Limit

A character gains limit by:

-   Choosing it as a Drawback.

-   Acting against one of their Intimacies, or other deeply-held
    beliefs.

“Acting against an Intimacy” can range from directly suppressing
Intimacies in order to proceed with the “greater good”, to being tricked
and swindled into taking action against your Intimacies, such as through
Social Influence. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not the
Character has “acted against their Intimacy” is a personal one, and
should be at the discretion of the Player.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>The Calming Effect of Time</strong></p>
<p>Typically, Limit <em>only</em> resets after a Limit Break. However, long spans of rest, meditation, and peace may ease the Exalt down from their stressed life.</p>
<p>So long as the time breaks are particularly restful, the Exalt may lose 1 Limit per week.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Limit Triggers

When detailing out their Great Curse, the Player will also need to
decide what sort of events will **inflame** their Great Curse. This is
called the **Limit Trigger.**

A compassionate character might balk whenever they see a wanton,
senseless act of cruelty upon another—such as a slave being whipped.
Another might be the sense of failure and dejection when a plan spirals
out of control.

When this event occurs (and the character has at least 2 Limit,) the
Player must roll a 1d10. If the die roll matches or exceeds their
current Limit, the Character is able to control their emotions for the
remainder of the scene.

However, if the roll is **under** the current Limit, the Character
enters a **Limit Break**.

### Limit Break

When a character **Limit Breaks,** they lose all perspective on anything
that does not align with their **Great Curse** and will make active and
considered effort to fulfill it, regardless of the consequences.

A character Limit Breaking does not lose their faculties, nor do they
forget their Intimacies—but those are simply *secondary* to their Great
Curse. Often they will use convoluted and strange reasoning to justify
their actions.

A Limit Break lasts for an entire scene. Only performing a grave offense
against their own deeply-held Intimacies would be enough to snap the
character out of their actions prematurely.

At the end of a Limit Break, reset Limit to 0.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Ticking Time Bomb</strong></p>
<p>There will be occasions when a character enters Limit Break, but turning it into a Limit Break Scene just doesn’t fit—it occurred during a lighthearted scene, or when the Exalt is in the middle of nowhere on their own, or the scene was just wrapping up.</p>
<p>If this occurs, with both the Storyteller and Player in agreement, the Character can postpone the Limit Break to a more appropriate scene—just don’t wait <em>too</em> long.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Strifes
-------

The world of Creation will push even the mighty Exalted to the brink,
and in those moments of desperation, forcing them to delve into reserves
they did not know they had. This moment is called a **Strife**.

Players are restricted to keeping no more than **5 Strife Points** at a
time. If Strife is gained above this limit, it must immediately be spent
in the Scene or be lost.

### Using Strife

#### Strife Expression

Each Exalt and their Caste, has a unique **Expression** that can boost
their Dice rolls.

For example, Solars may double a favored dice, while Sidereals
manipulate what the Target Number of a roll will be.

Each Exalt’s particular Strife Expression is detailed in their
respective book.

#### Introduce a Fact

The Player is allowed to introduce a Fact about the setting, detailing
something that is (and always has been) true in the world of Creation.

This Fact must be internally consistent with what has already been shown
to be true about the world. As well, the Storyteller has a right to veto
this introduced Fact (in which the Strife Point is returned), but is
encouraged to try to make the new Fact work.

The Fact should be related to the Player’s character in some way,
drawing from their Favored Abilities, Specialties, backstory, or Merits
in some way. Introducing the Fact that there is ancient order of
warriors known to be in the general area would make sense for a Player
whose character is a swordsman, but not one whose character is a
sorcerer, for example.

#### *Charm-like Effect*

In addition to their Exalt and Caste Strife Expressions, all players may
use a strife point to create a charm-like effect, which will turn the
scene in their favor. Inspiration can be drawn from any existing
non-Greater charm, or it can be custom tailored for the situation.

When using a Strife, the action should simply happen without a roll. So
long as a character *should* be able to do something, and it is *cool*
for them to do so, it *does.* In this way, it can be thought of as a
more powerful Stunt.

The only exception being if it *directly* targets an Exalt-level
antagonist, in which case a contested roll may be used.

### Strife Limitations

There are a few guiding restrictions to keep in mind with Strifes,
similar to a Stunt:

-   Other character’s actions cannot be dictated: only those under
    control of the Player’s.

-   The Action cannot *directly* solve the scene; it can only assist and
    guide it.

-   The Action should flow naturally from the character—a Solar cannot
    suddenly shapeshift, for example.

##### Example 1

> The Archer turns from the Dragonblood threatening her and focusing her essence into a point on their arrow. With a sharp hiss of air, she lets it loose into the nearest mountain, watching as the arrow explodes in an impressive show of Anima. The mountain rumbles as the snow dislodges, causing the newly-fallen snow to groan, rumble, and then start cascading into a deadly avalanche which rushes into the passage, sealing it and cutting off the dynasts reinforcements.

“I’m going to use my archery to cause an avalanche”. This example
accomplishes two dramatic things: it changes the environment, but
ultimately it is about stopping the Antagonist’s time constraint on
their battle. It assists the Player and their scene, but does not solve
the pressing issue—the fight with the Dragonblooded.

##### Example 2

> The Sorcerer looks apprehensive at his map. The desert has become inhospitable to their travels, and the rations for their mortal followers slim—if a solution isn’t found, they will arrive exhausted, or be forced to take a detour through the Guild’s controlled areas. His brown furrows, then suddenly shoots up: “Turn the caravan west, I see a Dragonline I can tap for water!”

“He’s going to use Sorcery to pull up water from the ground.” In this
situation, the problem being addressed is exhaustion or avoiding a bad
decision—preventing a negative.

##### Example 3

> The Crafter analyzes the complex door in front of them, which is blocking their way, the code shifting and twisting before their eyes. “I can simply craft a new key to the puzzle. Hold on for a moment.”

“The door is locked? I can just open it with crafting.” Is **bad**
because the main objective of this scene is to get past the door
blocking their path. In a different scene where the door was not the
main obstacle, this *might* be acceptable. Instead, an alteration can be
suggested:

>  The Crafter analyzes the shifting patterns of the door, then with a swift kick, lodges one of the panels shut, stopping the patterns from constantly moving. “There, that should be easier to read now.”

“The puzzle glyphs are moving? I’m going to jam them down so it lowers
the difficulty.”

### Gaining Strife

Strife may be gained through two ways: **Botches** and **Scene
Complications**.

[<u>Botches</u>](/System/General_System/#botching) are Player-driven choices to drive their
character’s failure into a *magnificent* failure—a low so that they may
later rise to even greater heights.

#### Complications

A **Complication** is a tool for the Storyteller to inject danger,
twists, and story momentum into the Story—*without Player Characters
being able to meaningfully react.* (The Characters will almost certainly
react, but the outcome is a forgone conclusion.)

In other words, while Players can spend Strife to Turn the Scene in
their *favor*, Storytellers can give Strife to Turn the Scene *against*
the Players—not simply describe challenges or consequences of actions.

The Storyteller gifts a Strife Point to all Players who are affected by
this event—and this single Strife Point guarantees the *outcome* of the
event in the Scene, no matter how many attempts are made.

**Examples:**

-   An Antagonist group escapes after their defeat in a fight, slipping
    the bonds or escaping pursuit.

-   The Caves the Party is in start rumbling, warning of an imminent
    collapse in but two short Rounds.

-   A source of information shoots down interrogation techniques,
    refusing to divulge important details.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Rejecting Strife</p>
<p>Players, by accepting the Strife, are giving up their ability to change the course of the event.</p>
<p>They have the option of refusing to take the Strife Point, defying the Storyteller’s influence. (This must be an all-or-nothing decision between all Players receiving the Strife—all must reject, or else all must accept.)</p>
<p>If this happens, the Storyteller must let the Player Characters challenge the event in a fair manner.</p>
<p>The Storyteller should also take care not to <em>abuse</em> the Complication mechanic to the point where it becomes frustrating—if they find that Players are constantly rejecting Strife, or grumbling and accepting, make sure to talk with the Players to see if the direction of the game is what everyone agrees with.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The main source of Strife is gained by players choosing to **Botch**
their rolls.

Another source is being gifted a point by the Storyteller in exchange
for letting certain events unfold as described—in spite of Player
actions. For example, after a combat scene with a recurring antagonist,
the Storyteller would grant a Strife point to allow the antagonist to
escape without a (successful) pursuit, so they can lick their wounds and
try again.

Elsewhere and Equipment
-----------------------

The mechanisms of reality are flawed. Items, particularly those not paid
attention to, have a tendency to reappear and move to alternate
locations. Mortals will often attribute this forgetfulness, or not
recognize the incongruity at all, when in reality it is the tireless
motions of the Loom taking shortcuts.

Exalts, long ago, learned how to quietly and easily exploit this—simply
though sleight of hand, they can store their physical items in places
and not feel the weight nor brunt of the equipment. It is not unusual
for an Exalt to suddenly pull out a large daiklaive from little more
than a handbag’s opening.

Depositing or retrieving equipment from Elsewhere takes an entire
Action.

Sidereals have labeled this flaw as “Elsewhere,” since the items are
neither *here* nor *there*, but simply somewhere…else. Certainly it is
something that needs to be fixed. Eventually. Preferably by someone
else.

Elsewhere is not all-powerful. The Exalt must reasonably be able to
carry the items in the first place, and it must not be something that
has a particularly close and important tie to reality. For example:
living creatures cannot be kept in Elsewhere, as their mind and soul has
far too great of self-awareness to be forgotten by reality.

As well, while time does not affect items *inside* of Elsewhere, the
moment it is pulled out reality will quickly reassert itself. Food would
rot within seconds, and we iron rust within a blink of an eye.

Items stored in Elsewhere of a dead Exalt will eventually reassert
themselves into reality—often by finding themselves in nearby containers
that may not have existed until needed for this precise purpose.

Storyteller Timelines
---------------------

Rather than count the exact minutes and hours of effects, Exalted rely
on a more cinematic approach. A charm’s duration may be declared as a
*Scene*, for example.

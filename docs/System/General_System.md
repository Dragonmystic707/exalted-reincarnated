General System
==============

Actions
-------

When a character encounters a situation where their success is
uncertain, the Storyteller should call for an Action Roll to determine
the outcome.

The Storyteller will ask for a combination of an Attribute and Ability
that is appropriate for the situation, and then determine an appropriate
Difficulty for the roll. The Player will then roll a number of Ten-Sided
Dice (d10’s) equal to the combined rating of the selected Attribute and
Ability—this combined number is called the Dice Pool. This will be
referred to as \[Att+Abi\] xd10’s.

Some powers and actions will call out specific Attribute + Ability
combinations, such as \[Wits + Awareness\], but others may simply
specify one or the other. For example, an “Awareness Roll” or a “Wits
Roll”. The two still require a full \[Att + Abi\] combination, they
simply allow the non-specified part to be determined by the Storyteller.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Only Roll if the Result is Unknown</strong></p>
<p>If the outcome of an action is already known beforehand (either as a failure or a success), there is no need for a roll—simply declare what happens and continue on with the story.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Successes

After rolling their Dice Pool, the player needs to count the number of
dice that are showing digits equal or greater than the Target Number of
(7). Examine the results of six rolled dice:

**1, 4, 4, 7, 8, 8**

The values of 7, 8, and 8 are greater than or equal to (7), so they are
each counted as a success, meaning this particular roll would result in
3 Successes.

### Double 10’s

A die that shows 10 is counted as two successes, rather than one. If the
roll had instead been:

**1, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10**

7 and 8 would be counted once, and 10 counted twice, making a total of 4
successes on the roll.

### Difficulty

*Before a roll is performed*, the Storyteller should determine the
**Difficulty** of the roll—the number of successes that the roll must
match or exceed for the action to be considered a success. Here is a
guiding scale for choosing difficulties:

-   **Difficulty 1 (Easy)  
    **This task is expected to be passed by a skilled mortal, but there
    is still a reasonable risk of failing.

-   **Difficulty 3 (Typical)**- This task is challenging to a mere
    mortal, but an Exalted Hero is more than likely going to pass it.
    Picking a lock, calming an irate guardsman, or basic first aid would
    fall under this category.

-   **Difficulty 5** **(Difficult)**- Tasks which are daunting fall in
    this category—climbing a sheer cliff in winds, charming a staunch
    Dynast with sweet words, or avoiding the bite of a venomous beast.

-   **Difficulty 7 (Challenging)**- Tasks which should be
    near-impossible for any mortal. Such as noticing things in pitch
    darkness, or landing on a precise spot hundreds of feet below.

-   **Difficulty 9 (Impossible)**- Tasks a mortal could not possibly do,
    no matter the circumstances. Running straight up a building, leaping
    across a chasm unassisted, or keeping a patient alive without a
    heart for hours at a time with their bare hands.

<td><p><strong>Failing Forward</strong></p>
<p>In a high-powered setting such as Exalted, properly handling it is important, and is in a way more difficult than a success, as it puts the burden of keeping the story moving on you, the Storyteller. Remember: you are not there to punish the players for daring to take an action, only to provide boundaries, restrictions, and consequences.<br />
<br />
There are a few general paths to take:</p>
<p>1. <em>A simple failure</em>—the character don’t do the action, the story continues. Typically you pick this path when the players already know of different paths they may take. Sometimes letting your players step back and reanalyze their approach is</p>
<p>2. <em>An important part fails, but not all of it</em>—the character does squeak by on what they intended, but at a great cost. They open the doors, but only enough for one person to slip by or by causing a great commotion. Choose this path if halting the action would kill all momentum of the session.</p>
<p>3. <em>“No, but...”</em>—If players have heavily invested in an action, and it just doesn’t work out because of bad luck, don’t give them <em>nothing</em>. Sure, they failed at the task they were intending, but another pathway opens. Maybe they failed to convince the Queen of their plight, but the Prince overheard and wishes to speak to them. Be judicious of choosing this option, as overuse may make your game feel consequence-free.</p></td>

 Action types
------------

Most rolls are simple: the Player dictates what they are intending to
do, and the Storyteller tells them which (Attribute + Ability) to roll,
and how much the difficulty will be. While this is overwhelmingly the
most common dice setup, there are a few alternate rolls that can be
called for.

### Contested Actions

Certain actions are contested between abilities of two or more
characters, rather than a simple difficulty.

In this case, all characters simply roll their appropriate Dice Pool,
and compare who got the highest number of Successes.

#### Taking the Average

To speed things along, the Storyteller is encouraged to take the
*average* number, rounded down, of the NPC’s dice pool. If they have 4-5
dice, simply state that they get got 2 successes and move on.

The exception to this guidance are important characters, such as rivals
or foes of great challenge.

######### There are two characters in the scene: a guard and a thief. The guard is keeping watch, and the thief is attempting to sneak past them. The dice pool for the player-controlled thief would be Dexterity + Stealth.

######### Since this is a NPC, and there are no dice-affecting powers active, the storyteller simply takes the average: (Wits + Awareness)/2, which turns out to be 3. Should the thief match or surpass that difficulty, they successfully sneak past.

### Retrying Rolls

Once a roll has been decided, a Player cannot simply try the action
again—it is assumed that the character has already approached the issue
from multiple different angles before truly failing in the roll. For
example, their failed barter included multiple tiers of money that they
were willing to part with.

Only through powers like a Charm, or by a dramatic change of the scene
is a re-roll allowed—for example, the marketplace erupting in a great
conflict, convincing the merchant that they need to sell and leave as
quickly as possible.

### Recurring Rolls

The Exalted will suffer and inflict many sorts of ailments and statuses
ranging from toxins and diseases to more esoteric effects such as curses
and mental Influence.

The onset of the status is handled as normal: if resisting a toxin, it
would simply be a (Stamina + Physique) roll against the Difficulty of
the Toxin. On a success, they simply would not be poisoned.

On failing, they are now subject to the status effect, and now must
either wait for the status to run its course, or take *active*,
*considered* effort to try and cure themselves. Each time they take such
an action, they are allowed to roll to resist again and potentially
remove the effect. Each attempt must be some different methodology.

Any mundane statuses, even at their worst, will naturally be purged from
an Exalt if they are given a full day of rest.

### Teamwork

When a Player performs a successful action with the sole intent of
helping another character, they grant their target character +2 dice.
Alternatively, the Player may grant Peripheral Motes equal to the number
of successes rolled to target character.

A target cannot gain more than +2 dice on an action from teamwork,
though it explicitly stacks with other Advantages, such as Stunting.

Advantages and Disadvantages
----------------------------

The difficulty of an action can be modified by various conditions,
whether it be environmental, helpful, or antagonistic. These should be
provided by the Storyteller as deemed appropriate to the narrative.

By default, Advantages and Disadvantages are written in terms of
**dice** available for the character to roll: (+2/-2 dice). Since this
is the default, the “dice” moniker is often dropped—if a power ever
simply says “+2”, it means to dice.

Whenever a Modifier affects a static value, such as Resolve or
Difficulty, you should **take the average**, rounding up. +1 or +2 dice
is +1 to Resolve, for example. Some powers will directly reference
Static Value or Difficulty modifiers, instead of dice.

### Assigning Modifiers

Modifiers can be granted from any source, such as any powers, the
environment, or even the mental condition of the character taking the
action.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><blockquote>
<p><strong>Advantage/Disadvantage</strong></p>
</blockquote></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td></td>

<td><blockquote>
<p>±3</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Any **Modifier** should be something significant to the scene—something
that would perturb even an Exalt, and you should not concern yourself
with keeping track of anything and everything that *could* be a
modifier. Light rain, while thematic and aesthetic, would not be enough
to affect the athletics skill of the Exalt.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Natural Modifiers and Difficulty</p>
<p>Remember that Difficulty has its own inbuilt assumptions—many difficulties are set because they are a particular “base” level of challenge with a specific disadvantage: picking a difficult lock (3) vs. picking a difficult lock while blindfolded in a hurricane (9).</p>
<p>If a character uses a charm or power to dismiss part of that difficulty—removing all impairments caused by weather— it is the same as granting them an equivalent Advantage!</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Excellencies
------------

Exalts aren’t restricted to simply *accepting* the roll that is given to
them. When they need to, they may activate their Exalt-specific
Excellency to push their roll further than they thought they could, both
before they perform the roll, or after the roll (and all power effects)
have been finalized.

For example, a Solar will be able to add their Ability Ranks as a number
of Successes to their roll, turning what is a certain failure into a
success.

However, this does not come without a cost. The character is straining
themselves beyond their mortal bonds, and so will gain a point of
[Limit](/System/General_System/#limit), as well as inflame their [Anima Banner](/System/General_System/#anima-banner),
causing it to raise a level for the remainder of the Scene. The first
use of the scene will set the anima banner to *Glowing*, while the
second would set it to *Burning*.

Stunting
--------

The setting of *Exalted* encourages wild, ambitious, and perhaps
dangerous actions of the characters. When a player describes their
character doing their action in a fun and creative way, the Storyteller
should reward them. If the action described is reasonable and adds to
the Scene, the Storyteller should simply let the Player dictate what
happens without a roll—if a character swings from a chandelier in order
to drop down on top of an enemy, don’t slow that down with an Athletics
roll.

The Storyteller should grant the Player a Stunt as a reward and
encouragement to others to engage with the setting and scenery. That
said, Stunts should be kept short and sweet to keep the momentum of the
game moving forward.

Stunts should operate off of the “Rule of Cool,” and may bend the rules
a bit, both of reality and the game—such as falling great distances to
land perfectly in a pose.

### Spending Stunts

The Player may immediately use their Stunt on their action, gaining
either +2 dice or +1 defense.

Alternatively, they may choose to store it for later use. However,
Players may only store one Stunt point at a time.

 Strife
------

The world of Creation will push even the mighty Exalted to the brink,
and in those moments of desperation, forcing them to delve into reserves
they did not know they had—and can rarely replicate when needed. This
moment is called a **Strife**.

Strife is a powerful tool for Player Characters to change the world
around them.

By spending **8 motes** and performing or expending a Stunt, the Player
may:

-   Reuse any limited-use Power.

-   Use a Lesser or Greater Power they have not purchased. (They do not
    need to meet the prerequisites, save that they must be *able* to
    purchase it. A Solar cannot use a Lunar-specific Charm, for
    example.)

-   Invent a Charm-like Effect. The Player should feel free to dictate
    how they use their powers in a custom-tailored way for the
    situation, though this does require Storyteller approval to make
    sure it doesn’t *directly* solve the problem of the scene.

### Strife Guidelines

When using a Strife, the action should simply happen without a roll. So
long as a character *should* be able to do something, and it is *cool*
for them to do so, it *does.* In this way, it can be thought of as a
more powerful Stunt.

There are a few guiding restrictions to keep in mind with Strifes, which
should

-   Other character’s actions cannot be dictated: only those under
    control of the Player’s.

-   The Action cannot *directly* solve the scene; it can only assist and
    guide it.

-   The Action should flow naturally from the character—a Solar cannot
    suddenly shapeshift, for example.

**Example**

######### The Archer turns from the Dragonblood threatening her and focusing her essence into a point on their arrow. With a sharp hiss of air, she lets it loose into the nearest mountain, watching as the arrow explodes in an impressive show of Anima. The mountain rumbles as the snow dislodges, causing the newly-fallen snow to groan, rumble, and then start cascading into a deadly avalanche which rushes into the passage, sealing it and cutting off the dynasts reinforcements.

“I’m going to use my archery to cause an avalanche”. This example
accomplishes two dramatic things: it changes the environment, but
ultimately it is about stopping the Antagonist’s time constraint on
their battle. It assists the Player and their scene, but does not solve
the pressing issue—the fight with the Dragonblooded.

Essence
-------

Essence is the fundamental energy that flows through the world, all
creatures, and mortals—an energy that Exalts are naturally able to wield
to their advantage. A character’s Essence Rating is a measure of how in
tune the character is with the flows of energy through and surrounding
them.

Essence expenditure is measured in *Motes,* of which there are two
types:

### Personal Motes

Characters start with a Personal Mote Pool of 10, expanding it as they
gain Essence level. Personal Motes are depleted to fuel their Powers and
actions.

These motes represent the character’s internal, innate power: something
they always carry with them. They are slower to regenerate than
Peripheral Motes, but persist scene to scene.

Personal Motes are only regained when the character is performing
restful activities, such as sleeping, playing games, or otherwise
participating in relatively stress-free activities.

The entire Personal Mote pool will be regained after a full night of
rest. If a full uninterrupted night is not possible, the Exalt gains 1
mote back per uninterrupted hour.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Is it rest if I…</strong></p>
<p>Typically: No. If an activity has any dual purpose or gains advantage (aside from the passage of time), it is not considered rest.</p>
<p>A character may play a game to relax, but using a game to strategize a battle plan is not. Talking jovially (or in commiseration) with fellows is relaxing, while trying to convince friends to join in a plan is not.</p>
<p>That said, the Storyteller should not be overly strict when telling the Players to regain their Mote pool—a night is a night, only count hours when it truly matters.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Peripheral Motes

Peripheral Motes, as opposed to Personal, *are not retained* between
scene, and so character start at 0.

-   **Personal Motes** are intrinsic to the character. Expenditure of
    these motes are subtle and do not agitate their anima banner. This
    pool replenishes at a rate of 1 mote per hour of rest, or fully
    after a full night’s rest.

-   **Peripheral Motes** are the character’s ability to manipulate the
    world immediately surrounding them, channeling it to their will.
    Using these motes will *expose their anima banner*. This pool is
    completely refreshed at the *beginning of a new Scene.*

Anima Banner
------------

Exalts are brimming with energy, their souls suffused with the crackling
energy. Whenever they wish, they may choose to inflame this energy,
crackling their soul outward in various levels from a soft glow around
their body to a full towering bonfire of personal iconography and
symbols deeply personal to the character.

Whenever they *intentionally* flare their Anima, they may also quickly
retreat it back into their soul. (Both showing and recalling the anima
is instantaneous.)

However, when a character uses **5 motes** or more on an action, the
Anima Banner will *uncontrollably* start to spill out, and the Exalt
cannot do anything but wait for time to pass before they can recall it
back into their soul.

The Difficulty for *general onlookers* in the Scene to notice the Anima
Banner is equal to how many Peripheral Motes are remaining. However,
characters who are *face-to-face,* or otherwise directly engaged with
the Exalt, typically do not have to roll to notice the anima Banner once
it reaches the Glowing stage, or are granted a Moderate (+4) Advantage
to do so.

The Anima Flare should dissipate by the start of a new Scene, or roughly
after an hour has passed.

###  Anima Steps

The anima gradually increases as the peripheral mote pool is depleted,
but there are specific notable steps along the way:

-   **Dim**  
    This is considered the **default** or **natural** state of the
    anima. It is invisible to all natural senses, but may be seen by
    those that can peek into the Spirit Realm.

-   **Glowing  
    **A thin outline of the anima appears around the character, with the
    respective Caste Mark appearing on their brow. Characters standing
    face to face will most likely notice it, but may not be able to make
    out the exact iconography.

-   **Burning**  
    Essence burns and sheds from the Exalts body, much like the burning
    of a fire. The Caste Mark is unmistakable to any close-by.

-   **Bonfire  
    **A grand display of solidified Essence wraps around the body,
    shining its personal iconography to all of those in the scene.

 

The Great Curse
---------------

Exaltation is a great and wondrous blessing from the Gods, but with it
comes a great and terrible Curse. Perhaps, as the ancient and lost
stories speak, the slain Enemies of the Gods lay this Curse upon their
servants as a last, spiteful word in their dying breath. Or perhaps it
is simply inalienable nature of man, exemplified and given root in
power.

Regardless of its source, every Exalt carries with them the Great Curse,
an aggrandized character flaw that can interrupt and sabotage a
character’s well meaning in spite of their better nature.

Each individual Exaltation book details their Great Curse, but it is
important to know that these are all *suggestions*. So long as a
character has a flaw that affects their decision, it is an acceptable
Great Curse. Custom descriptions should always include three aspects:
what the flaw exposes in the character, what triggers the flaw, and what
the character will (most likely) do when they enter a Limit Break.

-   **Solars** suffer from their own Ego. They are those that tirelessly
    seek greatness and perfection, and may find others or even
    themselves not up to the standards they desire.

-   **Lunars** suffer from being trapped between worlds and are
    conflicted by the unknown. Are they man or beast? A part of society
    or apart from it? Their form is constantly shifting, so who are they
    really?

-   **Abyssals** have a portion of their self consumed by the void:
    something that is lost and that can never be reclaimed. It may be
    their name and relations; their lost vitality; a loss of emotion and
    feeling.

<p>If you find yourself gaining too much or too little Limit as the sessions happen (the goal is an average of 1 per Session), feel free to fine tune and adjust the scope of the Limit Event.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Limit

The stress and wear of an Exalt’s life will build and press upon them,
eventually driving them to a breaking point. This is represented by
Limit Points.

A Character gains 1 limit point by either encountering the triggering
event they have detailed (no more than once per scene), or by activating
their Excellency.

Limit Points represent how strained the Exalt is—how much wear and tear
their psyche and soul is under. The character starts at 0, not being
stressed, and can raise up to 10, a level of duress which they cannot
stand anymore, at which point they will be forced Limit Break.

#### Breaking Early

When a character is particularly stressed, such as by being defeated,
having their goals turned against them, their Intimacies being credibly
threatened, or any other event the Player deems “anguishing,” they may
see if the character Limit Breaks early.

Roll a 1d10. If the result is equal to or higher than their current
Limit, the character keeps it together. While they might be perturbed,
hurt, otherwise emotionally compromised, they retain full faculty of
their mind and actions. However, if they roll under their limit, they
prematurely snap.

The Player, knowing their character better than any at the table, may
forgo the roll altogether and simply decide their character snaps.
Remember, this should highlight the character’s flaws, and how it can
impact and impede the character’s own goals!

<p>So long as the time breaks are particularly restful, the Exalt may lose 1 Limit per week.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Limit Break

When a character **Limit Breaks,** they lose all perspective on anything
that does not align with their **Great Curse** and will make active and
considered effort to fulfill it, regardless of the consequences.

A character Limit Breaking does not lose their faculties, nor do they
forget their Intimacies—but those are simply *secondary* to their Great
Curse. Often they will use convoluted and strange reasoning to justify
their actions.

A Limit Break lasts for an entire scene. Only performing a grave offense
against their own deeply-held Intimacies would be enough to snap the
character out of their actions prematurely.

At the end of a Limit Break, reset Limit to 0.

During a Limit Break, the character does not gain any limit—even from
activating their Excellencies. This effectively grants them free use of
the Excellency for the entire scene, though it will still raise their
anima level.

<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Ticking Time Bomb</strong></p>

<p>If this occurs, with both the Storyteller and Player in agreement, the Character can postpone the Limit Break to a more appropriate scene—just don’t wait <em>too</em> long.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 Storyteller Timelines
---------------------

Rather than count the exact minutes and hours of effects, Exalted relies
on a more cinematic sense of time.

-   **Round**  
    Enough time for all characters present in the scene to perform at
    least one set of Actions.

-   **Scene**  
    Long enough to set out and accomplish a single, dedicated task.
    Combat from start to finish would be a scene, as would characters
    searching for clues in an old abandoned monastery. This typically
    spans minutes to hours.

-   **Session**  
    A single sitting of when Players begin and end roleplaying, spanning
    an entire night.

-   **Story**  
    Several sessions that form a full narrative arch: from establishing
    a threat to reaching the resolution.

-   **Chronicle**  
    A complete game, encompassing all the stories relevant to a set of
    characters.

Magnitudes
----------

*Exalted* is styled in more of a cinematic, broad-sweeping style game
rather than a precise simulation war-game. Instead of detailing out
every person, time frame, or area, it will instead deal with measures of
*magnitude.*

Some Powers will declare an increase (or decrease) in a *magnitude*.
Those magnitude definitions are as follows:

Elsewhere and Equipment
-----------------------

The mechanisms of reality are flawed. Items, particularly those not paid
attention to, have a tendency to reappear and move to alternate
locations. Mortals will often attribute this forgetfulness, or not
recognize the incongruity at all, when in reality it is the tireless
motions of the Loom taking shortcuts.

Exalts, long ago, learned how to quietly and easily exploit this—simply
though sleight of hand, they can store their physical items in places
and not feel the weight nor brunt of the equipment. It is not unusual
for an Exalt to suddenly pull out a large daiklaive from little more
than a handbag’s opening.

Depositing or retrieving equipment from Elsewhere takes an entire
Action.

Sidereals have labeled this flaw as “Elsewhere,” since the items are
neither *here* nor *there*, but simply somewhere…else. Certainly it is
something that needs to be fixed. Eventually. Preferably by someone
else.

Elsewhere is not all-powerful. The Exalt must reasonably be able to
carry the items in the first place, and it must not be something that
has a particularly close and important tie to reality. For example:
living creatures cannot be kept in Elsewhere, as their mind and soul has
far too great of self-awareness to be forgotten by reality.

As well, while time does not affect items *inside* of Elsewhere, the
moment it is pulled out reality will quickly reassert itself. Food would
rot within seconds, and we iron rust within a blink of an eye.

Items stored in Elsewhere of a dead Exalt will eventually reassert
themselves into reality—often by finding themselves in nearby containers
that may not have existed until needed for this precise purpose.

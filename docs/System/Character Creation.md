Aspects of the character are measured in **Dot Ratings,** the higher
number representing greater proficiency. Dot ratings range from 0-5,
with 0 being untrained, 2 average, and 5 masterful.

An online character sheet is provided
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x2HMrSpvbnjuPyWsJxIqGz17zCdvyaTQnok4N7NBqFk/edit?usp=sharing).
(So long as this is the most up-to-date version of the pdf.)

**<span class="smallcaps">Steps</span>**
----------------------------------------

1.  Choose your Exaltation and associated Caste, noting down any special
    abilities granted.  
      
    Your Exaltation will influence everything about your character, from
    what charms they may take, so take some time exploring your options.

2.  Choose Three [Intimacies](/System/The System/#intimacies), which are simple sentences
    that describes your relation or devotions to certain ideals, people,
    or places.

    Your Intimacies together should answer the questions:

    -   What is a tie I have to the world around me? Why do I care
        whether the world is destroyed or not?

    -   What pushes me to continue forward, in spite of all the
        hardship, danger, and anguish I will encounter?

    -   Why do I stick with the party? Is there a particular character I
        resonate with? Do we share a common goal?

3.  Choose your character’s [Great Curse](/System/The Exalted/#the-great-curse), the
    character flaw which your Exalt struggles with day in and day out.
    Example Great Curses are provided with your Exaltation, as each
    exalt tends to follow similar themes, but they by no means need to
    be followed verbatim.

    Describing a Great Curse should answer these questions:

    **How is the character flawed?**  
    How does the Curse describe your character? Are they overly
    compassionate, taking on the worlds ills onto themselves at their
    own detriment? Are they a braggart, who cannot help but show off?

    **What aggravates the flaw?**  
    What is something that you can encounter in the world that will
    cause the Great Curse to rear its ugly head? Is it the sight of
    those in power mistreating those that they are supposed to protect?

    **What happens?**  
    When your character cannot take the accumulated stress of their
    adventures anymore, what action will they (most likely) take? Do
    they shut themselves off from the world? Do they take action,
    ignoring any potential consequences

4.  Distribute **16 dots** into [Attributes](/System/The Exalted/#attributes). Each must be
    at least 1, and no more than 5. Attributes are your general skills,
    applied constantly to the world.

    Suggested Spread:  
    *\[4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1\]*

5.  Describe your specific skills, or [Abilities](/System/The Exalted/#abilities).

    -   Record any Supernatural Abilities granted from your Exaltation.

    -   Choose **3 Abilities**, which are your primary skills—what your
        character is *known* for.

        Set them to either:  
        *\[5, 4, 3\]* or *\[4, 4, 4\]*

    -   Spend **15 dots** in the remaining Abilities, with none being
        higher than **3** at this time.

        Suggested:  
        *\[3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1\]*

6.  Gain **3 Lesser Powers,** which are situational and unique effects
    your character can have in the world.

    Powers can be any combination of:

    -   Universal Charms

    -   Exaltation Charms.

    -   Spells

    -   Martial Arts

    -   Artifact Evocations.

7.  Detail out the [Armor and Weapons](armor-and-weapons) your
    character uses. Any other mundane equipment the character has need
    not be written down—so long as it is a reasonable thing for your
    character to carry, it may be used.

8.  You may now spend **16 xp** freely. You may use this to increase
    Abilities past **3**.

    Keep any experience that is unspent.

1.  Detail the character’s [Merits](/System/The Exalted/#merits), which are external aspects
    of your character—allies, money, backgrounds, and history.

    -   Write two **Facts** about the character’s past.

        -   One should be dedicated to your history, such as the city
            they lived in, or if they are from an important family
            lineage.

        -   The other should be dedicated to a past accomplishment.
            Often, this is directly tied to why you were chosen to be an
            Exalt.

    -   Mark down **two** standard **Languages**: one representing your
        local tongue, and one common to the all the Player Characters
        (typically Riverspeak).

    -   Gain **7 Dots** of Merits**,** with which to purchase additional
        merit dots. A **4 dot** merit may only be purchased with
        storyteller permission

        Suggested:  
        *\[3,2,1,1\]*

### Finishing Touches

Once your character has been finalized, it is time to record static
values. If you are using the provided character sheet, this next part
will be completed automatically.

1.  Choose a name for your character and describe them. This description
    should include your [Anima Banner](/System/The Exalted/#anima-banner), the personal
    soulshape of light that surrounds your character when brimming with
    power.

<!-- -->

1.  Set your [Essence](/System/The Exalted/#essence) to 1, the starting point for all
    Exalts. This sets you apart from most mortals who do not have an
    essence rating at all. (Essence 0).

2.  Start with a **Mote Pool of 8**, which is how you empower might
    charms, spells, and techniques. The pool starts completely filled.

3.  **Health**  
    Set to 20, then add (Physique) additional points.  
    In a combat scene, represents how long you may remain in the fight
    before collapsing from fatigue.

4.  **Accuracy**  
    (Weapon Att. + Weapon Ability) + (Weapon Acc)  
    The Attribute and Ability you use to calculate accuracy is dependent
    on your weapon. For example, a Heavy Maul will require Strength and
    Close Combat, while a Light Bow would require Dexterity and Ranged
    Combat. See [Weapons](armor-and-weapons).

5.  **Damage**  
    Greater of (Strength, Dexterity, or Essence), and add your bonus
    from (Weapon).

    When attacking a foe, this is the amount of wounds you inflict upon
    the foe by default.  
      
    Martial Arts or chosen weapons, can change or modify the base
    damage, but can never bring it lower than (Essence).

<tr class="odd">

<p>When taking the average of numbers, always round up to the nearest whole number.</p></td>

1.  **Evasion**  
    (Dexterity + Athletics)/2 + (Armor Modifier)

2.  **Block**  
    (Strength + Physique)/2 + (Armor Modifier)

3.  **Resolve**  
    (Wits + Integrity)/2.  
    Used to defend against anything that would sway your mind and
    actions, from deceptively sweet words to mind-altering Spells.

 Advancement
-----------

Essence increases automatically depending on how much **total** xp has
been gained, (+30xp) for each level.

|             |              |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Essence** | **Total XP** |
| 1           | 0            |
| 2           | 30           |
| 3           | 60           |
| 4           | 90           |
| 5           | 120          |
| 6 (+)       | 150 (+50)    |

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Essence 6+</strong></p>
<p>Once an Exalt reaches Essence 6, they start to transcend mortal boundaries. They may push their Attributes and Abilities past rating 5, up to their current Essence Level.</p>
<p>Each Essence Level past 6 requires 50 xp.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Remember that each Essence Rank provides:

-   +5 Health

-   +2 Maximum Motes

-   Ensures a minimum Base Damage of (Essence)

At **Essence 3** and **Essence 5**, the character gains access to
purchasing **Greater** and **Capstone** charms, respectively.

You may only save up to **One** **Power’s** worth of experience to
purchase higher level powers on reaching this milestone—e.g. you cannot
reach Essence 3 and then suddenly have 5 Greater Charms in your
repertoire

###  XP Gain

Player Characters in the same group should be kept at the same amount of
experience points, so that no single character gets significantly ahead
or behind others—as well, it takes the entire group to create moments,
not individuals.

Players should gain **Two XP** as a base for each Session, and gain an
additional **One XP** for meeting any and each of the following:

-   Creating a moment of excellent roleplay.

-   A character falling victim to their Great Curse, impeding their
    journey in some way. This does not need to be a Limit Break.

-   Reaching a milestone in a player character’s personal story.

-   Reaching a milestone in the overarching Story.

-   Suffering a great defeat.

Gain **Two XP** for any of the following:

-   Finishing a Story.

-   A Player Character being forced to cheat death, or actually dying.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Tuning Experience Gain</strong></p>
<p>Consider how long you want to play the game, and adjust your base Experience gain based on how quickly you want to meet milestones. Remember that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An average of 5xp will be 6 sessions a level,<br />
or 30 Sessions to reach Essence 6.</p></li>
<li><p>An average of 7xp will be 4 sessions a level,<br />
or 22 Sessions to reach Essence 6</p></li>
<li><p>An average of 10 xp will be 3 sessions a level,<br />
or 15 Sessions to reach Essence 6.</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Gaining Resources

Project Resources should be sought out and rewarded, based on the
Player’s actions in the story—it represents everything from riches,
favors, or manpower gathered.

Each point of Resources is equivalent to a dot of Merits, or a scale of
a World Project. However, Merits or Projects of Scale **4 or Higher**
must seek out a **Keystone** to complete the project.

Unlike Experience Points, Resources *do not* need to be the same between
characters—deciding who gets what is completely a decision that can be
done in character, if something is limited.

 Alternate Starts
----------------

### Higher Essence Starts

If you wish to start at higher Essence, the following are *suggested*
paths for character advancement—you are not *required* to level up this
way.

Follow Character Creation, and then add an additional:

|                     |           |           |           |           |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|                     | **Ess 2** | **Ess 3** | **Ess 4** | **Ess 5** |
| **Attributes**      | 1         | 3         | 4         | 5         |
| **Abilities**       | 4         | 5         | 7         | 8         |
| **Lesser Powers**   | 3         | 5         | 6         | 7         |
| **Greater Powers**  | \-        | 1         | 3         | 4         |
| **Capstone Powers** | \-        | \-        | \-        | 1         |
| **Merits/Projects** | 5         | 10        | 15        | 20        |

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Player Character Exceptionalism</p>
<p>Player Characters are unusual in just how quickly they progress, and are not bound by their Exaltations limits. This is <em>unusual</em> and not representative of the world at large.</p>
<p>For example, it often takes decades or even a millennia to reach Essence 5, a marker that may be reached within a year for your Player Characters.</p>
<p>As well, non-Player Characters are far more restricted by their Exaltation: the vast majority of Dragonbloods are at Essence 2 or lower, for example.</p>
<p>This is ignored for the sake of fun, and making sure each Player at the table are at the same level.</p>
<p>If you truly wish to exaggerate the difference between Exaltations for Player Characters (this is not recommended for new Players), use the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Dragonbloods and Liminals</strong> advance at +30xp until Essence 3, +50xp until Essence 5, then +100xp after Essence 5.</p></li>
<li><p>Most other Exalts start at Essence 2, with an extra 8xp to spend at character creation. They advance every +30xp until Essence 5, then at +50xp.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Solars, Abyssals, and Infernals</strong> start at Essence 3, with an extra 12xp to spend at character creation. They advance every +20xp until Essence 5, then +40xp.</p></li>
</ul></td>

### Mortal Start

It is quite natural to want to start the adventure before the Exalted
have become what they are. This should be taken with great care and
coordination with your Players—this a game of the Exalted, not mortals,
after all.

Even as a mortal, those Destined to become Exalted are heroic, above
normal mortals. They follow this creation guidance:

#### Steps

1.  Distribute **12 dots** into Attributes. Each must be at least 1, and
    no more than **3**.

    *Suggested:**  
    **\[3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1\]*

<!-- -->

1.  Select **3 Abilities** that your character is known for. One of
    these may be a *Supernatural Ability* that will be gained when
    Exalting, though they must take the *Endowed (3)* Merit to reflect
    this.

    Set these abilities to:  
    *\[4, 3, 3\]*

2.  Distribute **9 dots** in any of the remaining Abilities. None can be
    brought above 3.

3.  Gain one **Fact** dedicated to your history.

4.  Mark down **two** standard **Languages**: one representing your
    local tongue, and one common to the all the Player Characters
    (typically Riverspeak).

5.  Gain **4 dots** of Merits. You may go into keystone debt to do so,
    and may purchase Special or Supernatural Merits.

6.  Detail out the [Armor and Weapons](armor-and-weapons) your
    character uses. Any other mundane equipment the character has need
    not be written down—so long as it is a reasonable thing for your
    character to carry, it may be used.

7.  You may now spend **8 xp** freely. You may use this to increase
    Abilities to no more than **4**.

8.  Set **Health** to 15, then add (Physique) additional points.

9.  The remaining derived values are calculated as normal.

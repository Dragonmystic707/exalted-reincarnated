The Time of Tumult is one of great conflict, and the Exalted that live
through it will invariably find themselves in armed conflict, wielding
their great weapons and powers of destruction.

The Combat Round
----------------

Combat is split into distinct Rounds, where each character has a chance
to take one Action, such as Attacking, using a Charm, or any other
maneuver that they might wish to perform. Any powers that take up a full
action are denoted as **Simple** Powers.

On their turn, a character is able to perform two actions, though only
one can be a **Strike** by default. (e.g. a single **Maneuver** and
**Strike,** or **two Maneuvers**.) The Actions may be performed in any
order the Player desires.

There are some charms or powers that may grant a bonus action. **There
is a hard limit of 1 bonus action per Turn**, no combination of Powers
or effects can exceed that limit. Supplemental Powers that grant a
maneuver’s *effects* through do not count to that limit. (e.g. If a
Charm that supplements a successful Strike with *knockback*.)

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Combined Actions</p>
<p>Often, the actions of a character will be against a single target. While, mechanically, these are two different actions, they do not need to be described as such. For example, if a character performs a Brawl Strike and then Holds a foe, it can easily be described as “I lash forward, grappling them down, hitting them onto the floor.” Each aspect would still require the roll to see if it was successful, but they are handled by the same description.</p>
<p>If there is a Stunt, apply the benefits to both rolls.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Turn Order

In combat, Turns follow a swinging back-and-forth focus: once one
character finishes their actions, it is passed to the next side to the
opponent with the most narrative weight or physical proximity to the
action, as determined by the Storyteller. For example, if a Player
Character is attacking a monster, the monster would be the next to go in
the action, and then the spotlight would swing back to the Player
Character closest to the monster.

Each character only takes one turn per Round. Once all combatants on a
side gone, the remaining characters finish their turns—no character
should be skipped in a Round (unless they willingly passed.)

The first person to act in the combat scene should naturally flow from
the end of the last scene—if a character launched a surprise attack, or
was the first one on the combat scene, they are the one to act first.

However, if it unclear (as it often is,) the first character to act is
determined by a (Wits + Awareness) roll performed as combat breaks
out—the character with the most successes acting first, (Ties are
resolved with a coin flip)

The Storyteller is the ultimate arbiter of the combat flow, guiding this
alternating spotlight as they feel best fits the mood, but characters
volunteering for an action, or passing their action over to a fellow
character should be encouraged and respected as best as possible.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Alternate Turn Orders</p>
<p>Turn Order is a mechanic highly and contentiously discussed. Everyone has their favorite way of handling combat—all with their own individual benefits.</p>
<p>Ultimately, what matters is simply agreement on a system, so that each Player’s turn can be quick and responsive—the exact method can be altered based on personal preferences, or even in response to a specific scene.</p>
<p>Here are a few alternates:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Static</strong>: At the beginning of combat, all characters roll (1d10) and add (Athletics). Each round, characters go from highest number to lowest.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Popcorn</strong>: Each character takes their action, and then the controlling Player designates the next character to act until all have acted in the Round.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Nominated Team:</strong> The side with the highest total number of successes among all characters goes first. Each round, the team nominates which character will act for their turn.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### *Held* Actions

A character may use up one of their actions to wait for a specific
event, where they can use their other action to either act *before* or
*after* the event, at their discretion. This must be a specific,
non-arbitrary event such as “when someone comes through this door.”
Players *must* tell the Storyteller what the event is—they cannot
arbitrarily wait.

A character may hold their action until it is their Turn again in the
next Round. If by this point the event has not happened, the held action
is simply lost and the character must take their new Turn as normal.

 Zones
-----

Characters are constantly in motion in the battlefield—performing
acrobatics, running across the walls, and rushing from point to point.
Even the least mobile among the exalted do not simply stand in a single
spot waiting to be hit.

For this reason, rather than lock characters down with a required
movement action, the battlefield is split into distinct Zones, which
characters can freely move within and attack each other without
limitation.

When entering combat, the Storyteller should designate the battlefield
into distinct Zones that have logical boundaries related to scene, such
as “inside the inn” or “on top of the rooftops.” Zones should be split
up logically based on the terrain, though if the Storyteller may choose
to chop up a zone into smaller categories if they feel they are too
large (i.e. a north and south side of a long path.)

There is no set size for a zone—they can be as large or small as is
narratively required.

### Move

Take an action to relocate between Zones. By default, this does not
require a roll. However, if there are situations such as rough terrain,
environmental effects, or if another character is restraining or
otherwise blockading a path, a roll will be called for.

### Attacking between Zones

Ranged weapons, such as bows, have the option to attack cross zone lines
as though they were in the same zone. However, zone boundaries often are
marked by some sort of barrier, such as walls, which *would still*
impede an attack.

Attacks crossing a Zone boundary suffer a **-2** dice penalty, but may
be negated by taking an **Aim** Maneuver. Each Zone boundary adds its
own dice penalty, and must be negated by its own individual Aim
Maneuver. For example, striking across 3 Zone boundaries would impose a
-6 dice penalty, and would require 3 Aim Maneuvers to fully counter.

**Aiming** is an action that must be declared against the target you
intend to hit. You cannot simply take a general aim action.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Zone of Control</p>
<p>Occasionally, a Zone might be focused around a character—typically some giant monster that dominates the battlefield, and often extends just as long as the creature’s reach. This is considered a “Zone within a Zone”</p>
<p>Aside from being mobile, this Zone follows most of the same rules—characters must be in that Zone to make melee attacks (including the creature itself). But there are a couple special considerations:</p>
<p>1. The creature can move within and between Static Zones as normal.</p>
<p>2. The creature can force a target character into its Zone of Control by approaching them. This may be done once freely a turn, targeting a single character within the same Static Zone. (Common Sense may bring other characters in too—such as if a group is describe as huddling together.)</p>
<p>3. Characters must always use a roll when attempting to leave the Zone of Control.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Maneuvers
---------

A Maneuver is any action the character performs to gain advantage over
the scene—be it to test the stance of their enemies, analyze the
battlefield for strategic advantage, or to intimidate your foes through
physical prowess.

Simple Charms, Powers, and other effects that do not deal damage are
considered to be a Maneuver.

The Player describes any action that would grant them tactical
advantage, and then rolls the appropriate \[Att + Abi\] dice pool if one
is called for. If there is a Difficulty of **None** on the Maneuver,
they simply declare they are taking that action, and move on—no roll
needed.

Remember, Exalted follows the dynamic and cinematic model—heroes should
be leaping across narrow banisters, dancing steel in testing feints, and
channeling their inner might during combat. Nearly any action, if
described well enough, can grant a bonus to combat.

The one hard and fast rule of a Maneuver is that it **cannot deal
damage—**that is a Strike. Knocking back a character through a wall,
shattering the wall is a Maneuver. Knocking back a character into a
wall, shattering their bones, is a Strike. (Knocking them back into the
wall, breaking it *and* shattering their bones would be a Maneuver and
Strike actions, which would narratively be combined together.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>On Hit</p>
<p>Many combat powers will call for something to happen “on hit”. If not specifically calling out a Strike, this can also include Maneuvers that target the specified Difficulty involving physical contact between the two characters/their weapons. For example, knocking back a character with a kick.(or specified difficulty, such as Block and Evasion).</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Build Power

The Action “Build Power” is considered a Maneuver in combat. Typically
it will focus on gaining the tactical edge over the scene—studying
movements of the foes, centering yourself, or making feinting moves.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>What can’t I do?</p>
<p>Maneuvers are simply normal actions taken in combat, and so follow the same rule: “Does this make sense?” There are few hard limits imposed, rather relying on the judgment of the Storyteller and fellow players for the tone of the setting.</p>
<p>Can you knock back an enemy on a wave of sound by performing an epic ballad on your essence guitar? (Charisma + Performance) Whether or not this is something you want in your game is your choice.</p>
<p>During combat, Physical Attributes and Martial Abilities can do the most, rarely needing an explanation or stunt to justify their actions.</p></td>

Strike
------

> **Hit**: (Accuracy) &gt;= DV  
> **Damage:** (Accuracy) + Base Damage – DV - Soak

If you truly wish to kill your opponent, you may do so by striking at
them with a dangerous attack. These can be performed against any
character within range that is not specifically protected by some sort
of narrative defense—such as a wall or a giant chasm. If a character
attempts to attack an ineligible target, remind them and ask them to
take another action instead.

By default, a Strike must use use either **Strength** or **Dexterity**,
paired with **Brawl, Melee,** or **Marksmanship**. Attacking with any
other Attribute/Ability requires either a Stunt, Storyteller permission,
or a dedicated Power.

The dice pool to attack is called **Accuracy,** which should be recorded
on the character sheet for quick reference. It is the (Attribute +
Ability) referenced above, with any bonuses added from your fighting
style, and any Powers and Advantages you might have.

After declaring an attack, roll the **Accuracy** pool. If the number of
successes is less than the target’s **DV**, the attack misses. If it is
greater or equal to, it hits.

On a hit, subtract the **DV** from the number of successes on the
**Accuracy** roll—this is called your **Threshold Successes**. Add that
to your **Base Damage**, and the total amount is the damage the target
takes.

If the target has **Soak**, they absorb that much damage, but the rest
is taken from their Health Pool.

</ol></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Targeted Attacks

Certain Powers will call for a **targeted** attack, attacking a derived
value such as Evasion or Resolve, or calling for a contested roll. These
bypasses the normal defense structure.

Instead of **DV**, you will use whatever defense is declared on the
Power. For example, you may directly target Block against a highly
Evasive enemy, both increasing your chances of hitting and gaining more
damage in the process.

 **<span class="smallcaps">Combat End</span>**
---------------------------------------------

Combat ends when the outcome of the scene has been determined—you don’t
need to grind out all the health from opponents to know they are
defeated.

Once the direction of the Scene is determined, the Storyteller may drop
out of Combat and into a Narrative scene, letting the players resolve
combat as they see fit—or try to recuperate from its losses.

The Exalted are also known to stop combat through strange ways—such as
breaking the will of combatants so they no longer are their enemies.
Moments like this should be *encouraged*, and there is no special reason
that characters will keep attacking past reason.

### Fleeing

It is not unreasonable that one side or another will, instead of waiting
to be slaughtered, or outright surrender, they will instead try to flee
for their lives.

There are two methods to contest this. (Simply allowing one side or the
other to flee is also an option.)

One, is to transfer into an **Encounter**, where chasing or fleeing is
the goal of the encounter, and the Key Issues are impediments to
trapping or routing the fleeing characters.

The other is to attempt to keep the fleeing characters in combat. In
this case, all fleeing characters need to leave and external-facing
Zones through a contested Athletics roll on their turn.

Defeat
------

Characters who are knocked out of battle are typically not dead—they are
simply at the mercy of the opposing characters. Though, the Storyteller
should rightfully note the effects of various types of damages used,
such as slashing or piercing, and indicate that minor characters may
perish without active action.

Characters rarely fight to the death—or even to the point of being
knocked. Surrender, escape, or other options will become the pressing
concern of any NPC who gets at or below **5 Health.** They gain an
Intimacy of “survival” at this point.

Player characters who are defeated and in mortal danger must **Cheat
Death** in order to avoid their fate, explaining their (implausible)
escape/return. If they are not in mortal danger, they still gain **1
Limit** from the humiliation of defeat. (Friendly sparring matches and
competitions are excluded.)

### <span class="smallcaps">Healing and Recovery</span>

Health lost in combat is regained much in the same way motes are:
through rest and relaxation. **15 Points** of Health are regained after
a full night’s rest, or **2 points** per hour if it is interrupted.

 The Environment
---------------

The Environment itself can be a “character” involved in combat, as a way
to simulate things ranging from earthquakes to the turning of the night,
to things such as the advancement of a firestorm raging through a city.

The Environment is generally impervious to any attacks thrown at it (You
may throw water at a fire to repel its advances, but typically not
pierce it with arrows), and does not have a mind of its own to
coordinate.

If an Environmental “attack” is all encompassing in a Zone and
predictable, such as rumbling earth, a landslide, falling a great
distance, or a burning flame, there is *no need* to make an Attack roll.
It is assumed to hit and deal damage.

|                          |     |
|--------------------------|-----|
| **Environmental Damage** |     |
| Light                    | 3   |
| Medium                   | 5   |
| Heavy                    | 7   |
| Oppressive               | 9   |

Battle Groups
-------------

Minor Characters, especially those that cannot alone damage their foes
will naturally fall into **Battle Groups**.

Groups act as a single character, but gain the following bonus based on
their **Group Magnitude:**

-   Add 5 Health for every Magnitude Scale increment.

-   Add 1 Damage, 1 Accuracy, and +1 Dice on an action for every
    Magnitude Scale increment

 Fighting Style
--------------

A character’s **Fighting Style** is a combination of the **Weapon Type**
and the **Weapon Style** with which ist is weilded. These two aspects
are completely linked, and cannot be changed once created. For example,
taking the Weapon Type: Melee, and the Fighting Style: Two-Handed
describes a two-handed greatsword. It cannot simply be changed to a
One-Handed style due to its intrinsic nature.

A character can have up to two Fighting Styles at a time, which can be
switched to and from using a Maneuver Action. (The base ‘style,’
Unarmed, or no style, does not count on this limit.) This represents the
time it takes for the character to swap their weapons out. Specific
Fighting Styles are often called out as a requirement for a Martial
Arts.

Note that a Fighting Style **cannot increase Block or Evasion past 5.**

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Can my Weapon Pull Double Duty?</p>
<p>The default assumption is that each Fighting Style has an individual weapon associated with it: you fight with a firepiece in one stance, and a sword in another.</p>
<p>If you wanted to combine the two into one weapon, creating a gunblade, that is perfectly fine. It provides no mechanical benefit, but it is cooler.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Weapon Types

The weapon type is defined by what Ability it uses, and gains a few
benefits along the way:

-   **Brawl  
    **+1 Accuracy, 3 Base Damage  
    Typical weapons: None, tiger claws, natural weapons, brass knuckles,
    spiked boots.

-   **Melee  
    **Grants 4 Base Damage  
    Typical weapons: Sword, spear, club, mace, whip.

-   **Marksmanship  
    **+1 Accuracy. 2 Base Damage, May attack at all ranges.  
    Typical weapons: Bow, flamepiece, crossbow, throwing spear.

#### Exotic Types (Custom)

Exotic abilities, those that are not of the list above, can be used with
the coordination and approval of the Storyteller. For example, **Craft**
could be paired with **Reach/Thrown** to represent throwing explosives
as an attack.

Exotic Types offer no other benefit, save for 2 Base Damage. By default
(without a custom style), they still require Strength/Dexterity as the
paired Attribute.

### Weapon Style

#### Grapple Master:

(Brawl-Only)  
+1 Evasion (max 5)

You may *Grapple* opponents, occupying them in close hand-to-hand combat
in a way that they cannot escape. As a Maneuver, roll (Dexterity +
Brawl) against their Evasion. If successful, you Restrain them for a
Round, plus additional Rounds for every 2 extra Successes on the roll.

When Restrained, you have an extra +2 dice to attack the target. As
well, you may prematurely end the grapple as a maneuver, throwing or
slamming the target against physical material, immediately dealing 5
damage to them (which may be soaked.)

#### Defensive Posture:

+1 Block (max 5)  
*Often represented as having a shield in the off-hand.*

Choose a target at the start of combat. You may reflexively defend them
as long as you are in their Zone. As well, you may reflexively move one
Zone to meet your protectorate, though it consumes your next Maneuver.

#### One-Handed:

+1 Accuracy, +1 Damage  
*A balanced style, allowing great flexibility and general bonuses.*

You can **call** a Strike, taking a Maneuver to specify the target and
how you are performing the called shot. (e.g. a specific body part,
trying to use psychology against them, etc.) All Strikes against this
character gain +2 Acc. for the remainder of the Scene, or else until you
switch targets.

#### Two-Handed:

(Strength-only)  
+2 Damage  
*Focused on overwhelming power over all else.*

You may brazenly attack. Perform a Maneuver, calling out a specific
*target.* Lower your DV by 1 until your next Round in order to target
Evasion instead of DV on your next Strike against the target.

#### Dual-Wielding:

(Dexterity-Only)  
+1 Accuracy, +1 Damage  
*A surprise attack from the off-hand weapon will catch most opponents
off-guard.*

Once per battle, you may immediately Reroll a Strike should it fail.
Afterwards you may spend 2 Anima to re-use this ability. Only one reroll
per Strike is allowed.

#### 

####  Reach/Thrown:

(Marksmanship excluded)  
Allows attacking at range, but only across one Zone Boundary.  
**Note:** you do not lose access to your weapon after throwing it.
Either it returns (like a boomerang), you have a chain to pull it back,
or you have multiple copies.

At the beginning of combat, call out an enemy—you do not suffer Ranged
Penalties for attacking them. You may switch targets as a Maneuver.

### Custom Style

You are by no means restricted to these listed styles, and may work with
your Storyteller to craft your own.

You are granted 2 base points to spend on a style:

0 points (flavor restrictions)

-   Restricting to Strength or Dexterity

-   Restricting to or excluding a Weapon Type

The following each cost 1 point.

-   1 dice of accuracy (max 3)

-   1 damage (max 3)

-   +2 Dice on a specific action

-   Allows the use of an Exotic Attribute.

-   Minor consistent benefit

-   Moderate situational benefit

The following each cost 2 points

-   Moderate consistent benefit

-   Major situational benefit

-   1 Block/Evasion (max 1)

-   1 Soak (max 1)

You may **gain points** if you take a penalty, which are *inverse* of
the above—for example gaining a point if you have a 1 dice *penalty* to
accuracy. You cannot gain more than 3 points total from this method.

Once the points have been granted, you should give the Style a **Power**
that enhances the style—some sort of **Maneuver** that gives the style
its flavor. This should be equivalent to a **Lesser Power** in strength.

 Armor
-----

-   **Light** armors are those that have been tailor made to aid in
    flexible movement—above and beyond what normal clothes will do.
    Typically, light armors will consisted of padded gloves, tightly
    wound fabrics, and other cushions to assist in acrobatic movements.

-   **Medium** and **Heavy** armors provide increasing Block protection,
    but at the cost of more limited mobility. Most traditional armors,
    such as breastplates, chain shirts, and articulated plate fit into
    the Medium or Heavy Category.

Note that **Mundane Armor** cannot increase Block or Evasion **past 5.**
Any Block or Evasion above this limit becomes **Soak**.

### Artifact Armor

Artifact Armor gains +1 Soak to all categories, in addition to their
specific bonuses. This will be reiterated with the artifact stat block.

 Equipment and Elsewhere
-----------------------

The mechanisms of reality are flawed. Items, particularly those not paid
attention to, have a tendency to reappear and move to alternate
locations. Mortals will often attribute this forgetfulness, or not
recognize the incongruity at all, when in reality it is the tireless
motions of the Loom taking shortcuts.

Exalts, long ago, learned how to quietly and easily exploit this—simply
though sleight of hand, they can store their physical items in places
and not feel the weight nor brunt of the equipment. It is not unusual
for an Exalt to suddenly pull out a large daiklaive from little more
than a handbag’s opening.

Sidereals have labeled this flaw as “Elsewhere,” since the items are
neither *here* nor *there*, but simply somewhere…else. Certainly it is
something that needs to be fixed. Eventually. Preferably by someone
else.

Elsewhere is not all-powerful. The Exalt must reasonably be able to
carry the items in the first place, and it must not be something that
has a particularly close and important tie to reality. For example:
living creatures cannot be kept in Elsewhere, as their mind and soul has
far too great of self-awareness to be forgotten by reality.

As well, while time does not affect items *inside* of Elsewhere, the
moment it is pulled out reality will quickly reassert itself. Food would
rot within seconds, and we iron rust within a blink of an eye.

Items stored in Elsewhere of a dead Exalt will eventually reassert
themselves into reality—often by finding themselves in nearby containers
that may not have existed until needed for this precise purpose.

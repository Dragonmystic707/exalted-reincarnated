Combat
======

The Time of Tumult is one of great conflict, and the Exalted that live
through it will invariably find themselves in armed conflict, weilding
their great weapons and powers of destruction.

Combat in Exalted focuses on the rythmn of battle, with characters
constantly testing each other, looking for openings, and strategizing
through Maneuvers, until they have built up enough Impulse to strike
with a Decisive Blow.

Combat Values
-------------

### Impulse

Impulse is a meaure of the current *tactical advantage* the character
has. The higher the value, the greater the control they have over the
battlefield.

Maneuver Actions grant Impulse to the Player, which they then use on
Decisive Actions—often to strike at their opponents with great force.

Being that it is gained and spent exclusively during a combat scene,
physical tokens (such as coins or poker chips) are suggested to keep
track of Impulse.

### Static Values

-   **Endurance** *  
    *The measure of how energy and action the character has left in
    them. Once a character’s Endurance pool is exhausted through damage,
    they have lost the will and/or physical ability to keep fighting and
    will collapse in exhaustion.

-   **Defense Value (DV)** *  
    *Reflects the character’s ability to deflect, dodge, or otherwise
    mitigate an incoming attack.

-   **Evasion** *  
    *Represents the ability for characters to quickly move and respond
    to changes in the battlefield.

-   **Soak *  
    ***The hardiness of a character, the raw ability to take a hit
    without it affecting them at all.

-   **Accuracy  
    **The ability to land a hit with an attack. This value is highly
    dependant on the weapon used—for example, a short bow is a light
    archery weapon, so would use Dexterity, Archery, and provide an
    Accuracy Bonus. This is described in more detail in the
    [Weapons](/Combat/#weapons-and-armor) section.

-   **Base Damage***  
    *When a Decisive Attack lands, a portion of the of the dice pool
    comes from a player’s Base Damage—in essence, it is the minimium
    amount of power behind any striking attack.

-   **Initiative  
    **How quickly a character can react to the start of battle,
    determining their turn order as well as the starting amount of
    Impulse.

The Combat Round
----------------

Combat is split into distinct Rounds, where each character has a chance
to take one Action, such as Attacking, using a Charm, or a Maneuver.
Characters also may perfrom as many *unique* Free Actions as desired,
such as Movement, during their turn.

Turn order is determined by all character’s rolling a Chance Die (1d10),
and adding their **Initiative** score. The characters then proceed from
highest to lowest, then restarting the round once all characters have
gone.

If there is a tie of Initiative between a Player Character and a
Non-Player Character, the Player gets to choose who goes first. If there
is a tie between Player Characters, simply flip a coin.

Each combatant starts with a number of Impulse equal to their Initiative
score.

**Turn Order:** 1d10 + (Initiative)  
**Starting Impulse:** (Initiative)

All combatants are assumed to start combat ready: their weapons are
drawn, they have fallen into their Martial Arts, etc.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Balancing Large Groups</p>
<p>Player Characters only get One Action per round. But Non-Player Characters are not beholden to this rule. The Storyteller may choose to let a NPC have up to 3 actions per Round—if they are particularly powerful and dangerous foes.</p>
<p>The Rule of Thumb is to have antagonists acting no less than 1/3 of the Player actions.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Ambush Round

If characters are ambushed—not expecting combat in the least, they must
suffer through an Ambush Round.

Instead of starting combat as normal, Ambushed characters instead start
with **0 Impulse**, and may only act *after* all other characters have
acted, regardless of their Turn Order. Once the Ambush Round ends,
normal turn order resumes.

Ambushes are premeditated affairs--requiring setup, planning, and
coordination between the party. Players cannot suddenly go into combat
if things are not going their way and declare it an Ambush.

Player Character always get a Reflexive (Cunning + Awareness) roll to
individually avoid becoming Ambushed.

### Holding Action

Characters may choose to Hold their Action, waiting for something to
happen in order to respond to it.Players must describe what it is they
are waiting for—they cannot arbitrarily wait.

When the specified event happens, they must spend **2 Impulse,** and
then take their action as desired, (either before or after the specified
event, at their choice)

If the event does not happen in the Round, the Player loses their
action. (But they do not need to spend the Impulse).

Maneuvers
---------

A Maneuver is any action the character performs to gain advantage over
the scene—be it to Intimidate their foes, test the stance

Endurance
---------

Endurance is a value measuring how much fight a character has left in
them. Once a character’s Endurance Pool has been exhausted, either
through pain, disheartenment, or whatever means are employed, the
character is considered out of the battle.

### Defeat

Characters who are knocked out of battle are typically not dead--they
are simply at the mercy of the opposing characters.

Non-recurring antagonistic characters' fates should be left to the
players. Depending on the narrative type of damage (slashing, stabbing,
etc.) these minor characters may perish without aid.

#### Player Character Defeat

For defeated Player Characters, this often will mean that their
antagonist will successfully accomplish their plans, gloat about it, and
then introduce a **Major Complication** into the player’s lives.

#### Recurring Antagonist Defeat

If they are intended to be a recurring antagonist, they should always
manage to get away, though suffering a major blow to their own
plans--they will often be forced to retreat and lick their wounds.

If you force a retreat on these Antagonists, you must bribe your players
each with a [**<u>Strife Point</u>**](-qlg0g56pfcyu) as compensation.

Remember, though, that recurring antagonists can only be used so many
times--eventually you will have to move to the Final Confrontation,
where the fate of these antagonists should be placed into the Players’
hands.

#### Death and Dying

The death of any central characters to the story should be pivotal and
moving to the story. Player Characters will only die on defeat if it is
something the Player wishes for their character.

A dramatic moment of death is a perfect send-off and ending for one of
the members of the Exalted.

Likewise, central Non-Player Character deaths should be determined by
the Storyteller, although they must bribe all the Players with a
**Strife Point** to avoid such a fate--something that the Players are
allowed to reject should they so choose.

Static Defense
--------------

Characters use a Static **Defense Value (DV)** to defend against all
attacks made. By default, this is the greater of **Evasion** or
**Soak.**

Defense mitigates attacks, reducing the incoming damage by the
characters DV. An attack that reduces the incoming attack damage to Zero
(0) is considered a **Miss**.

### Armor

Armor grants a **Soak Bonus** protection to a character, but at the cost
of a **Evasion Penalty**.

All armor is of three categories: Light, Medium, and Heavy. Martial Arts
Styles will often dictate and restrict what level of armor can be worn.

### Bypassing Defenses

There are attacks that can bypass certain defenses, which then must rely
on other defenses instead of pure DV. The Prime examples of these are
**Undodgeable** and **Unsoakable** attacks.

**Undodgeable** attacks bypass Evasion. Examples would be room-filling
explosions and damage from gravity.

**Unsoakable** attacks bypass Soak Examples would be piercing damage,
and attacks that manage to get under armor.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>There’s Always a Defense<br />
</strong>There is no such thing as a Perfect Attack--there is always some sort of flaw or counter to an attack, even if the damage can’t be mitigated through DV. This must be taken into account when creating your own custom Powers.</p>
<p>Environmental Damage, such as Fire, is both Undodgeable and Unsoakable when applied. However, it is tied to specific parts of the environment--simply moving outside of the burning building will counter this source of damage.</p>
<p>Even mighty Sorcerous Spells have a great disadvantage: the slow and obvious buildup to the attack beforehand.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Situational Defense
-------------------

There are two levels of Situational Defenses in Exalted: **Partial** and
**Full**.

**Partial** means that the Attacking Player has a -3
Disadvantage--effectively increasing the defending Player’s DV by 3.

**Full** means that they cannot be attacked by mortal means.

Situational Defenses often can be countered by natural means: characters
can move across the battlefield, or scale a wall.

**Situational Defenses do not stack.** It is either Partial, or Full.
However, multiple defenses must often be addressed individually. If a
character is hiding behind a wall (Full) as well as at a distance
(Partial), if the wall is destroyed by an action, the Range Defense
would still apply.

### Cover

Characters may use the terrain to gain Situational Defenses, such as by
ducking against rubble or hiding behind a wall. Taking Cover is not an
assumed action: it is a specific **Secondary Action** that characters
may take.

Cover is considered **Partial** when at least half a character’s body is
blocked by a material that can withstand weapon blows--such as a
chest-high wall of broken stone rubble.

Cover is considered **Full** when the character’s entire body is
blocked, such as behind a wall.

Typically, cover works both ways: a character in Full Defense from
attacks is also blocked from attacking others for the same reason.

### Range

Range is the most prevalent and common source of Situational Defense, so
much so that it has special rules.

#### Range Bands

Characters are constantly in motion during combat, running down
alleyways and leaping off tree limbs. Rather than rely on absolute
positioning, Exalted works off of *relative* positioning between
characters, divided into specific **Range Bands**.

Characters are assumed to keep in their same relative Range Band until
one side makes a deliberate effort to change it through a **Move
Action**.

Move Actions may also change relative range bands to other characters.
If moving towards a character in a group, all characters in that group
would be one range band closer. This secondary effect is dependent on
the Storyteller’s judgement.

There are Eight Range bands, split along Five Categories: **1x Close, 1x
Short, 2x Medium, 3x Long,** and **1x Far.**

> **Close**
>
> Within arm’s reach.
>
> **Short**
>
> Within a few yards of each other--a distance able to be crossed within
> a quick sprint.
>
> **Medium**
>
> Far enough that conversations would have to be shouted, and an archer
> would have to take preparations for a proper attack.
>
> **Long**
>
> Across an entire field, far enough away that visual, rather than
> verbal, signals would have to be used.
>
> **Far**
>
> Term for “outside of the battlefield”. Characters cannot get *to* the
> Far Range band through Move actions, but any late-comers to the battle
> will show up at this Range Band.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Alternate Rules:<br />
Battlemaps and Absolute Positioning</strong></p>
<p>While relative Range Bands are the recommended method of playing Exalted, some players prefer to play with absolute positioning and battlemaps. If that is your preference, make the following changes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Distance will be measured in meters. Typically, hexagonal space (hex) will represent 5 meters.</p></li>
<li><p>Characters have a <strong>Speed</strong> Static value, which is 3 + (Dex + Athletics )/2.<br />
The distance travelled is Speed x5 meters--or (Speed) Hexes at a time.</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever the Move Action is taken, the character moves (Speed) hex.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>A Dash moves (Speed)x2.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>A character may move 5 meters (1 hex) on their action without taking a Move Action.</p></li>
<li><p>All references to (Range Band) as a distance is 25 meters (5 hexes).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The definition for range bands are altered:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>0-5 meters (0-1 hex): <strong>Close</strong></p></li>
<li><p>6-20 meters (2-5 hex): <strong>Short</strong></p></li>
<li><p>21-70 meters (6-15 hex): <strong>Medium</strong></p></li>
<li><p>71-145 meters (16-30 hex): <strong>Long</strong></p></li>
<li><p>146+ meters (31 hex): <strong>Far</strong></p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Close Attacks

**Close Attacks**, such as those made with **Melee** and **Brawl**, may
be made at Close Range with no defense applied, and at Close Range with
Partial Defense. Any further ranges enjoy a Full Defense.

-   **Close**: None (0)

-   **Short**: Partial (-3)

-   **Medium+**: Full (N/A)

Attacking a Short range (or further, with the right Powers) does not
change the relative range band. It is assumed that the character rushes
in, attacks, and then cannot hold the position for more than an instant.

#### Ranged Attacks

**Ranged Attacks,** such as those made with **Archery** and **Thrown**
are made at Short Range with no defense. At Medium they suffer a Partial
Defense, whereas Long+ cannot be attacked at all.

**Ranged** attacks may take an **Aim** action to eliminate Range Partial
Defense of Medium+ attacks.

At **Close** range, ranged attacks are hampered by the control the
opponent has claimed over the area, and so also suffer a Partial
Defense. However, this defense *cannot* be countered with an **Aim**
action.

-   **Close**: Partial (-3)  
    Cannot use Aim action to counter.

-   **Short**: None (0)

-   **Medium:** Partial (-3)

-   **Long+:** Full (N/A)

Attacks and Damage
------------------

A standard attack is equal to the number of Successes from **Attack
Roll**, plus the character’s **Base Damage**. The total damage dealt is
the difference between that number and the target’s **DV**, and is
subtracted from the target’s Endurance.

**Attack Power = \[Attack Roll\] + Base Damage**

All Powers and modifiers applied to an attack must be declared in use
*before* the attack roll is made, unless specifically detailed
otherwise.

The Attack Power must then be finalized. Only then will the Defense
Powers be declared and activated. No additional attack modifiers may be
made at this point.

**Damage = Attack Power - DV**

#### Miss

A **Miss** will occur when either the **Attack Roll** as 0 Successes, or
if the total damage after DV is 0. A Miss does no damage to the target.

### Attack Roll

The standard attack’s Dice Pool depends greatly on the weapon that is
used during the attack. The Ability depends on how they are using a
weapon--a sword will typically be used with the Melee ability, but may
be used with the Thrown if it is used as a javelin.

The Martial Art Style that a character will use will restrict what types
and weights of a weapon may be used.

**Attack Roll** = (Attribute + Ability) + Accuracy

#### Attack Attribute

**Light** weapons depend on the nimble motions and precise placements of
attacks for the most effect in their attack, and so rely on
**Dexterity** as their Attribute to calculate an attack.

**Heavy** Weapons depend mostly on pure force, forgoing any sense of
precision. They thus use **Strength** as their Attribute.

**Medium** and **Unarmed** Weapons can be used with finesse or force,
and so use the greater of Dexterity or Strength.

### Base Damage

Base Damage is how much damage an attack will do, regardless of chance.

Flow
----

A Combat Scene starts with a **Join Battle** Roll, which is 1d10 +
**Initiative**. The order is from highest to lowest.

During their turn, a character may take One (1) **Primary Action**, and
One (1) **Secondary Action**.

After all characters have taken their action, the order starts from the
top and a new **Round** starts.

Combat ends when it has become clear which side is the victor, in which
all but one side of the conflict has lost all of their endurance. Play
will then enter into the next scene, which is often a recuperation and
consequences scene from combat.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Calling a Fight<br />
</strong>There will come times when the results have become clear, even if one side or the other has not exhausted their Endurance. This could be simply characters “mopping up” characters that cannot harm them, a protracted fight, or even a stalemate. There is no need to continue a Combat Scene in these cases.</p>
<p>Once the result is known, simply exit out into narrative space to describe how the combat finishes.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Holding Attacks

A Character may choose to hold their attack until a condition is met,
but take a -2 dice penalty for doing so.

If the condition is not met in the Round, they lose their action.

Primary Actions
---------------

### Standard Attack

Attack a single valid target.

### Flurry Attack

Make an attack against multiple targets. The attack is against the
target with the largest DV.

On a hit, the Damage of the attack is divided among all the targets.

### Disadvantage

Take a contested Roll in an attempt to distract, stun, or otherwise
Disadvantage the target.

If successful, the target **either** loses 2 DV for a Round, or **3
dice** from their next action.

The Action Roll may be things such as:

-   Intimidation (Strength + Physique)

-   Tactical Routing (Intelligence + Leadership)

-   Distracting Song (Charisma + Performance)

### Restrain

Make a contested Roll against the target’s (Dex + Athletics).

The target becomes grappled for 1 Action, and an additional action per ½
Threshold Successes.

While grappled, the target cannot take a voluntary **Move** Action. As
well *neither characters* may perform Flurries or use any weapon that
requires both hands.

When the controlling character takes a **Move** action, they must make a
contested (Str + Physique) roll against the clinched target. On a
success, both characters move a range band.

Restrainin Actions can be caused by:

-   Grappling (Dex + Brawl)

-   Whip chain (Dex + Melee)

#### Size and Grappling

This action gains +2 Automatic Success for each size category larger
than the target the attacker is, or -2 Automatic Failure for each size
smaller. I.e. A Medium character grappling a small character would gain
+2, while a small character grappling a Large would suffer -4.

Characters grappling targets at least 2 sizes larger than them cannot
**Move** the target, and are often characterized as only restraining a
certain limb.

Secondary Actions
-----------------

### Move

Change relative position to a target character by one Range Band, either
closer or further, terrain permitting.

At the cost of +1 Impulse, and -1 DV until the next character’s action,
the character can *Rush* to move two Range Bands. This cannot be done
two rounds in a row.

### Aim

Counter the Range Partial Defense of an attack made at Medium + range.

### Change Initiative

Move up to (Athletics) Initiative, which takes effect at the star of the
next round.

### Dive for Cover

Take Cover, gaining either Partial or Full Defense depending on the
terrain.

### Defend Other

Until your next action, you protect the target(s), using your Soak value
(if it is higher).

The target(s) must be within Short Range of your character to take this
advantage.

Environmental Effects
---------------------

\[\[**Todo: I need to flesh out the following:\]\]**

-   Fire

-   Unsteady terrain

-   Winds and other projectile suppressing tactics.

    -   Counted as some sort of Situational Defense.

Ambush Round
------------

If one side of a combat is prepared, and catches the other off guard,
this starts combat with an **Ambush Round**. Player Character should
always get a chance to counter this ambush with a (Cunning + Awareness)
Roll.

The Ambushed characters:

-   Do not act until after the non-ambushed characters.

-   Suffer -2 DV until their action.

Ambushes are premeditated affairs--requiring setup, planning, and
coordination between the party. Players cannot suddenly go into combat
if things are not going their way and declare it an Ambush.

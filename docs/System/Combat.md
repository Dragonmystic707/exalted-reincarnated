The Time of Tumult is one of great conflict, and the Exalted that live
through it will invariably find themselves in armed conflict, weilding
their great weapons and powers of destruction.

The Combat Round
----------------

Combat is split into distinct Rounds, where each character has a chance
to take one Action, such as Attacking, using a Charm, or any other
maneuver that they might wish to perform. Any powers that take up a full
action are denoted as **Simple** Powers.

On their turn, a character is able to perform two actions, though only
one can be a **Strike** by default. (e.g. a single **Maneuver** and
**Strike,** or **two Maneuvers**.) The Actions may be performed in any
order the Player desires.

There are some charms or powers that may grant a bonus action. **There
is a hard limit of 3 total actions per turn**, no combination of Powers
or effects can exceed that limit. Supplemental Powers that grant a
maneuver’s *effects* through do not count to that limit. (e.g. If a
Charm that supplements a successful Strike with *knockback*.)

If a character were to have a Charm that grants another Movement action
and a Charm that allows another Strike action, they would have to choose
whether or not to take an action such as: “Move, Move, Strike” or
“Strike, Move, Strike”, but “Move, Strike, Move, Strike” would break the
action limit.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Combined Actions</p>
<p>Often, the actions of a character will be against a single target. While, mechanically, these are two different actions, they do not need to be described as such. For example, if a character performs a Brawl Strike and then Holds a foe, it can easily be described as “I lash forward, grappling them down, hitting them onto the floor.” Each aspect would still require the roll to see if it was successful, but they are handled by the same description.</p>
<p>If there is a Stunt, apply the benefits to both rolls.</p></td>
</tr>

</table>

### Turn Order

The Storyteller starts combat by selecting the first side and character
to act. Often, this will depend on the context leading up to the scene,
such as one side ambushing the other. However, if it is ever unclear,
simply perform a relevant Action Roll, with the character that rolls
highest going first. Any ties should be determined by another roll. (If
it continues to be a tie, simply flip a coin.)

If there is a roll, by default it will be (Wits + Awareness) to
represent a character’s reaction to changing environments. However, it
*need not be*. Any sort of contested roll can be used—if racing towards
the battlefield, it would be (Dexterity + Athletics), for example. Or
perhaps (Insight + Socialize) to realize that a negotiation has turned
sour.

Once the starting character has been determined, they may take their
action, and then pass the action to another on their side. This
continues until all members of a side have performed an action, at which
point it switches to a character on other side, chosen by the last
character to go.

Once all characters on both sides have performed their actions, the
round starts over with the original starting character.

### Holding Action

Any character may Hold their Action, or wait to act based on something
that happens in the battlefield. To do so, the must describe what it is
they are waiting for: they cannot *arbitrarily wait.* When the specified
event happens, they get a chance to act *before* or *after* the event,
at their discretion.

However, if the event does not occur during the round, their action is
forfeited.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Optional: Alternate Turn Orders</p>
<p>Everyone has their favorite way determining turn order, and they all have their benefits. Ultimately, while necessary to have one, the exact system of turn orders is not important.</p>
<p>Here are a few alternates:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Static</strong>: At the beginning of combat, all characters roll (1d10) and add (Athletics). Each round, characters go from highest number to lowest.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Alternating Team:</strong> The side with the highest total number of successes among all characters goes first. Each round, the team nominates which character will act for their turn.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Focus</strong>: There is no turn order, rather the turn jumps from character to character at the Storyteller’s discretion. (This is best used for small groups.)</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Zones
-----

The battlefield is split into distinct areas—inside the inn, weaving
through the trees, or across the rooftops. These areas are called
**Zones**, and characters can freely move inside, interact with, or
importantly: attack any and all within the same zone. The character is
constantly moving in the Zone, performing acrobatics, flipping off the
walls, rushing from point to point—they do not simply hole up in a
single spot waiting to be hit..

Zones should be split up logically based on the terrain, though if the
Storyteller may choose to chop up a zone into smaller categories if they
feel they are too large (i.e. a north and south side of a long path.)

There is no set size for a zone—they can be as large or small as needed.

### Move

Take an action to relocate between Zones. By default, this does not
require a roll. However, if there are situations such as rough terrain,
environmental effects, or if another character is restraining or
otherwise blockading a path, a roll will be called for.

### Attacking between Zones

Ranged weapons, such as bows, have the option to attack cross zone lines
as though they were in the same zone. However, zone boundaries often are
marked by some sort of barrier, such as walls, which *would still*
impede an attack.

 Maneuvers
---------

A Maneuver is any action the character performs to gain advantage over
the scene—be it to test the stance of their enemies, analyze the
battlefield for strategic advantage, or to intimidate your foes through
physical prowess.

Simple Charms, Powers, and other effects that do not deal damage are
considered to be a Maneuver.

The Player describes any action that would grant them tactical
advantage, and then rolls the appropriate \[Att + Abi\] dice pool if one
is called for.

Remember, Exalted follows the dynamic and cinematic model—heroes should
be leaping across narrow banisters, dancing steel in testing feints, and
channelling their inner might during combat. Nearly any action, if
described well enough, can grant a bonus to combat.

The one hard and fast rule of a Maneuver is that it **cannot deal
damage—**that is a Strike. Knocking back a character through a wall,
shattering the wall is a Maneuver. Knocking back a character into a
wall, shattering their bones, is a Strike. (Knocking them back into the
wall, breaking it *and* shattering their bones would be a Combined
Manuever Strike, taking 2 Actions).

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>On Hit</p>
<p>Many combat powers will call for something to happen “on hit”. If not specifically calling out a Strike, this can also include Maneuvers that target the specified Difficulty involving physical contact between the two characters/their weapons. For example, knocking back a character with a kick.(or specified difficulty, such as Block and Evasion).</p>
<p>If there is no specified Difficulty, use Defense.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Build Power

The Action “Build Power” is considered a Maneuver in combat. Typically
it will focus on gaining the tactical edge over the scene—studying
movements of the foes, centering yourself, or making feinting moves.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>What can’t I do?</p>
<p>Maneuvers are simply normal actions taken in combat, and so follow the same rule: “Does this make sense?” There are few hard limits imposed, rather relying on the judgement of the Storyteller and fellow players for the tone of the setting.</p>
<p>Can you knock back an enemy on a wave of sound by performing an epic ballad on your essence guitar? (Charismsa + Performance) Whether or not this is something you want in your game is your choice.</p>

Strike
------

If you truly wish to kill your opponent, you may do so by striking at
them with a dangerous attack.

First, roll the (Attribute + Ability) roll of the attack adding dice
from Accuracy bonus gained from your weapon or charms. If the roll
exceeds the Defense (or targeted value) of the enemy, you successfully
Strike them.

Without the use of a Power or stunt, Striking is restricted to the
Physical Attributes (Strength, Dexterity) and the Martial Abilities,
typically Archery, Brawl, Melee, or Thrown.

### Damage

**Base Damage**, by default, is the highest of (Strength, Dexterity, or
Essence Level), as a character can pierce the defenses of their opponent
through brute force, precision strikes, or sheer force of will if the
other two do not apply.

The selection of Martial Arts may change or alter what source of damage
can be used—a light weapon may require Dexterity, or a heavy weapon
Strength. A more obscure style may wield Charisma as the damaging
attribute.

However, no matter the source, or restriction, **Essence** remains the
minimum for Base Damage.

The target’s health lost is the Base Damage, adding any bonus from
weapons or powers, and then subtracting any defensive bonuses. The
damage a character *takes* can be reduced all the way to 0—though this
is still considered a hit.

Defeat
------

Characters who are knocked out of battle are typically not dead—they are
simply at the mercy of the opposing characters. Though, the Storyteller
should rightfully note the effects of various types of damages used,
such as slashing or piercing, and indicate that minor characters may
perish without active action.

Characters rarely fight to the death—or even to the point of being
knocked. Surrender, escape, or other options will become the pressing
concern of any NPC who gets at or below **5 Health.** They gain an
Intimacy of “survival” at this point.

Player characters who are defeated gain **1 Limit** from the
humiliation, regardless of if they are in mortal danger or not.

### <span class="smallcaps">Healing and Recovery</span>

Health lost in combat is regained much in the same way motes are:
through rest and relaxation. **15 Points** of Health are regained after
a full night’s rest, or **2 points** per hour if it is interrupted.

### Death and Dying

A dramatic moment of death is a perfect send-off and ending for one of
the members of the Exalted. However, not all defeats are a dramatic
moment—sometime it is not time for a character to depart from the story.

The Player is the sole arbiter of the their character’s fate. If it is
not the time for their character’s story to end, that death becomes
cheated. Somehow, the defy the monumental odds, crawling days through
pain and anguish that none other have suffered for help.

But cheating death comes at a cost. The character will be invariably
changed from their experience. There will be scars of their
encounter—whether it is physical, mental, or social. The Player should
work with the Storyteller to come up with a consequence from the
implausible survival.

Suggestions are:

-   A dramatic change in Intimacies—such as the addition of (fear)
    related to the event.

-   A loss of an appropriate merit, such as an Ally who sacrificed
    themselves to save the character.

-   Physical reminders of the lost battles, such as scars.

-   Recurring nightmares, where the character is forced to relive the
    moment of their escaped death.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Antagonist Defeat</p>
<p>There will be times when an antagonist—intended to be recurring—is defeated, or otherwise dramatically halted.</p>
<p>These Characters, like Player Characters, have the ability to escape certain defeat if it best suits the plot. However, they should <em>also</em> suffer the same consequences for doing so.</p>
<p>Escaping death should never be cheap, and should not be done too many times. Let your Players have victories.</p></td>

The Environment
---------------

The Environment itself can be a “character” involved in combat, as a way
to simulate things ranging from earthquakes to the turning of the night,
to things such as the advancement of a firestorm raging through a city.

The Environment is generally impervious to any attacks thrown at it (You
may throw water at a fire to repel its advances, but typically not
pierce it with arrows), and does not have a mind of its own to
coordinate.

If an Environmental “attack” is all encompassing in a Zone and
predictable, such as rumbling earth, a landslide, falling a great
distance, or a burning flame, there is *no need* to make an Attack roll.
It is assumed to hit and deal damage.

|                          |     |
|--------------------------|-----|
| **Environmental Damage** |     |
| Light                    | 3   |
| Medium                   | 5   |
| Heavy                    | 7   |
| Oppressive               | 9   |

Minor Characters
----------------

Minor Characters, especially those that cannot alone damage their foes
will naturally fall into **Groups**.

Groups act as a single character, but gain the following bonus based on
their **Group Magnitude:**

-   Add 5 Health for every Magnitude Scale increment.

-   Add 1 Damage, 1 Accuracy, and +1 Dice on an action for every
    Magnitude Scale increment

Equipment
---------

### Armor

Wearing armor is a tradeoff in Exalted – you gain additional Block or
Evasion, and thus have a higher total Defense, but at the cost of
revealing a potential weakness to be exploited later on.

-   **Light** armors are those that have been tailor made to aid in
    flexible movement—above and beyond what normal clothes will do.
    Typically, light armors will consisted of padded gloves, tightly
    wound fabrics, and other cushions to assist in acrobatic movements.

-   **Medium** and **Heavy** armors provide increasing Block protection,
    but at the cost of more limited mobility. Most traditional armors,
    such as breastplates, chain shirts, and articulated plate fit into
    the Medium or Heavy Category

### Weapons

Weapons are built using Tags, each with an individual cost in points. No
individual tag may be applied to a weapon or armor more than once.

There are some tags with levels (e.g. Accurate (I) and Accurate (II)).
They are considered the same tag, and so cannot be applied to the same
weapon.

#### Mundane *Weapon Tags*

A standard mundane weapon starts with **3 Points** in order to craft the
weapon with a set amount of Tags.

Tags will often have some *requirements* associated with them. A weapon
cannot have conflicting requirements.

|                         |            |                                                                                  |

| Damaging (I/II/III/IV)  | (1/2/3/4)  | Gain +1/2/3/4 to weapon damage.                                                  |
| Ranged                  | 1          | You may attack across 1 Zone boundary.                                           |
| Long-Ranged             | 3          | You may attack across 2 Zone boundaries.                                         |
| Grappling               | 1          | The Accuracy of the weapon is added to any attempts to make a Restrain Maneuver. |

#### Special Tags

Special weapons, Powers or Martial Arts will grant specific tags to be
used when building a weapon. These are not available for purchase
normally.

|                         |            |                                                                                                                                              |

Elsewhere
---------

The mechanisms of reality are flawed. Items, particularly those not paid
attention to, have a tendency to reappear and move to alternate
locations. Mortals will often attribute this forgetfulness, or not
recognize the incongruity at all, when in reality it is the tireless
motions of the Loom taking shortcuts.

Exalts, long ago, learned how to quietly and easily exploit this—simply
though sleight of hand, they can store their physical items in places
and not feel the weight nor brunt of the equipment. It is not unusual
for an Exalt to suddenly pull out a large daiklaive from little more
than a handbag’s opening.

Depositing or retrieving equipment from Elsewhere takes an entire
Action.

Sidereals have labeled this flaw as “Elsewhere,” since the items are
neither *here* nor *there*, but simply somewhere…else. Certainly it is
something that needs to be fixed. Eventually. Preferably by someone
else.

Elsewhere is not all-powerful. The Exalt must reasonably be able to
carry the items in the first place, and it must not be something that
has a particularly close and important tie to reality. For example:
living creatures cannot be kept in Elsewhere, as their mind and soul has
far too great of self-awareness to be forgotten by reality.

As well, while time does not affect items *inside* of Elsewhere, the
moment it is pulled out reality will quickly reassert itself. Food would
rot within seconds, and we iron rust within a blink of an eye.

Items stored in Elsewhere of a dead Exalt will eventually reassert
themselves into reality—often by finding themselves in nearby containers
that may not have existed until needed for this precise purpose.

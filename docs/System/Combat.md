The Time of Tumult is one of great conflict, and the Exalted that live
through it will invariably find themselves in armed conflict, wielding
their great weapons and powers of destruction.

The Combat Round
----------------

Combat is split into distinct Rounds, where each character has a chance
to take one Action, such as Attacking, using a Charm, or any other
maneuver that they might wish to perform. Any powers that take up a full
action are denoted as **Simple** Powers.

On their turn, a character is able to perform two actions, though only
one can be a **Strike** by default. (e.g. a single **Maneuver** and
**Strike,** or **two Maneuvers**.) The Actions may be performed in any
order the Player desires.

There are some charms or powers that may grant a bonus action. **There
is a hard limit of 1 bonus action per Turn**, no combination of Powers
or effects can exceed that limit. Supplemental Powers that grant a
maneuver’s *effects* through do not count to that limit. (e.g. If a
Charm that supplements a successful Strike with *knockback*.)

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Combined Actions</p>
<p>Often, the actions of a character will be against a single target. While, mechanically, these are two different actions, they do not need to be described as such. For example, if a character performs a Brawl Strike and then Holds a foe, it can easily be described as “I lash forward, grappling them down, hitting them onto the floor.” Each aspect would still require the roll to see if it was successful, but they are handled by the same description.</p>
<p>If there is a Stunt, apply the benefits to both rolls.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Turn Order

In combat, Turns follow a swinging back-and-forth focus: once one
character finishes their actions, it is passed to the next side to the
opponent with the most narrative weight or physical proximity to the
action. For example, if a Player Character is attacking a monster, the
monster would be the next to go in the action, and then the spotlight
would swing back to the Player Character closest to the monster.

Each character only takes one turn per Round. Once all combatants on a
side gone, the remaining characters finish their turns—no character
should be skipped in a Round (unless they willingly passed.)

The first person to act in the combat scene should naturally flow from
the end of the last scene—if a character launched a surprise attack, or
was the first one on the combat scene, they are the one to act first.

However, if it unclear (as it often is,) the first character to act is
determined by a (Wits + Awareness) roll performed as combat breaks
out—the character with the most successes acting first, (Ties are
resolved with a coin flip)

The Storyteller is the ultimate arbiter of the combat flow, guiding this
alternating spotlight as they feel best fits the mood, but characters
volunteering for an action, or passing their action over to a fellow
character should be encouraged and respected as best as possible.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Alternate Turn Orders</p>
<p>Turn Order is a mechanic highly and contentiously discussed. Everyone has their favorite way of handling combat—all with their own individual benefits.</p>
<p>Ultimately, what matters is simply agreement on a system, so that each Player’s turn can be quick and responsive—the exact method can be altered based on personal preferences, or even in response to a specific scene.</p>
<p>Here are a few alternates:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Static</strong>: At the beginning of combat, all characters roll (1d10) and add (Athletics). Each round, characters go from highest number to lowest.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Popcorn</strong>: Each character takes their action, and then the controlling Player designates the next character to act until all have acted in the Round.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Nominated Team:</strong> The side with the highest total number of successes among all characters goes first. Each round, the team nominates which character will act for their turn.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### *Held* Actions

A character may use up one of their actions to wait for a specific
event, where they can use their other action to either act *before* or
*after* the event, at their discretion. This must be a specific,
non-arbitrary event such as “when someone comes through this door.”
Players *must* tell the Storyteller what the event is—they cannot
arbitrarily wait.

A character may hold their action until it is their Turn again in the
next Round. If by this point the event has not happened, the held action
is simply lost and the character must take their new Turn as normal.

 Zones
-----

Characters are constantly in motion in the battlefield—performing
acrobatics, running across the walls, and rushing from point to point.
Even the least mobile among the exalted do not simply stand in a single
spot waiting to be hit.

For this reason, rather than lock characters down with a required
movement action, the battlefield is split into distinct Zones, which
characters can freely move within and attack each other without
limitation.

When entering combat, the Storyteller should designate the battlefield
into distinct Zones that have logical boundaries related to scene, such
as “inside the inn” or “on top of the rooftops.” Zones should be split
up logically based on the terrain, though if the Storyteller may choose
to chop up a zone into smaller categories if they feel they are too
large (i.e. a north and south side of a long path.)

There is no set size for a zone—they can be as large or small as needed.

### Move

Take an action to relocate between Zones. By default, this does not
require a roll. However, if there are situations such as rough terrain,
environmental effects, or if another character is restraining or
otherwise blockading a path, a roll will be called for.

### Attacking between Zones

Ranged weapons, such as bows, have the option to attack cross zone lines
as though they were in the same zone. However, zone boundaries often are
marked by some sort of barrier, such as walls, which *would still*
impede an attack.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Zone of Control</p>
<p>Occasionally, a Zone might be focused around a character—typically some giant monster that dominates the battlefield, and often extends just as long as the creature’s reach. This is considered a “Zone within a Zone”</p>
<p>Aside from being mobile, this Zone follows most of the same rules—characters must be in that Zone to make melee attacks (including the creature itself). But there are a couple special considerations:</p>
<p>1. The creature can move within and between Static Zones as normal.</p>
<p>2. The creature can force a target character into its Zone of Control by approaching them. This may be done once freely a turn, targeting a single character within the same Static Zone. (Common Sense may bring other characters in too—such as if a group is describe as huddling together.)</p>
<p>3. Characters must always use a roll when attempting to leave the Zone of Control.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### 

 Maneuvers
---------

A Maneuver is any action the character performs to gain advantage over
the scene—be it to test the stance of their enemies, analyze the
battlefield for strategic advantage, or to intimidate your foes through
physical prowess.

Simple Charms, Powers, and other effects that do not deal damage are
considered to be a Maneuver.

The Player describes any action that would grant them tactical
advantage, and then rolls the appropriate \[Att + Abi\] dice pool if one
is called for.

Remember, Exalted follows the dynamic and cinematic model—heroes should
be leaping across narrow banisters, dancing steel in testing feints, and
channeling their inner might during combat. Nearly any action, if
described well enough, can grant a bonus to combat.

The one hard and fast rule of a Maneuver is that it **cannot deal
damage—**that is a Strike. Knocking back a character through a wall,
shattering the wall is a Maneuver. Knocking back a character into a
wall, shattering their bones, is a Strike. (Knocking them back into the
wall, breaking it *and* shattering their bones would be a Maneuver and
Strike actions, which would narratively be combined together.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>On Hit</p>
<p>Many combat powers will call for something to happen “on hit”. If not specifically calling out a Strike, this can also include Maneuvers that target the specified Difficulty involving physical contact between the two characters/their weapons. For example, knocking back a character with a kick.(or specified difficulty, such as Block and Evasion).</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Build Power

The Action “Build Power” is considered a Maneuver in combat. Typically
it will focus on gaining the tactical edge over the scene—studying
movements of the foes, centering yourself, or making feinting moves.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>What can’t I do?</p>
<p>Maneuvers are simply normal actions taken in combat, and so follow the same rule: “Does this make sense?” There are few hard limits imposed, rather relying on the judgment of the Storyteller and fellow players for the tone of the setting.</p>
<p>Can you knock back an enemy on a wave of sound by performing an epic ballad on your essence guitar? (Charisma + Performance) Whether or not this is something you want in your game is your choice.</p>

Strike
------

If you truly wish to kill your opponent, you may do so by striking at
them with a dangerous attack. These can be performed against any
character within range that is not specifically protected by some sort
of narrative defense—such as a wall or a giant chasm. If a character
attempts to attack an ineligible target, remind them and ask them to
take another action instead.

Without the use of a Power or a Stunt, Striking is restricted to the
Physical Attributes (Strength, Dexterity), paired with a Martial
Ability—typically Archery, Brawl, Melee, or Thrown.

The Accuracy of the roll is the (Attribute + Ability) dice, plus any
bonuses from weapons or powers.

If the roll matches or exceeds the higher value of the two Defenses:
Block and Evasion, the attack hits for **Full** Damage.

If the roll only matches or exceeds **one** of the two defenses, the
attack hits for the lesser **Glancing** Damage. The target was able to
either avoid or take the full brunt of the hit, but not enough to leave
without a scratch.

If the roll is less than both defenses, or has 0 successes, the attack
misses and no damage is dealt.

The target loses Health equal to the damage, minus any damage reduction
they may gain through Powers. If the damage is reduced all the way to 0,
the attack is still considered a hit.

</ol></td>

</table>

###  Damage Calculation

Damage is based off of the **Attribute** used in the attack. **Full**
Damage is (Attribute) + (Essence), while **Glancing** damage is
(Attribute)/2, rounded up.

Weapons and powers will often boost damage, and will be written as
follows:

**+Full / Glancing**

So a power that says “+2/1 damage” would add +2 Full Damage, and +1
Glancing Damage.

If, through any combination of powers or bonuses, Glancing Damage ever
becomes greater than Full Damage, you may choose to deal Glancing damage
during a Full hit. (You should never be punished for rolling too well.)

#### Third Defense

There are some Powers, Martial Arts, etc. that grant a third defense.
This new defense—typically limited in some way—will primarily help avoid
Glancing damage, replacing the weaker of Block or Evasion on normal
attacks.

#### Targeted Attacks

Certain Powers will call for a **targeted** attack, attacking a derived
value such as Evasion or Resolve, or calling for a contested roll.

This bypasses the normal defense structure

There are some Powers, Martial Arts, etc. that grant a third defense.
This new defense—typically limited in some way—will primarily help avoid
Glancing damage, replacing the weaker of Block or Evasion on normal

Maneuvers and actions that target Block or Evasion, however, remain
unaffected.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>A Note on Combat</p>
<p>If you run through the math, you will notice that characters are most likely to deal Glancing damage if they attack an equivalent foe—it is not difficult to raise the highest defense a point or two.</p>
<p>This is intentional, and there are two reasons behind it:</p>
<p>1. The game assumes—and encourages—tactical weakening of opponents defenses, as well as gratuitous boosting of their own attacks. Base attacks are unlikely to deal Full damage without said boosts.</p>
<p>2. Attacking consumes an action, while defending does not. Therefore, the chance of completely missing and dealing <em>no</em> damage is far more punishing than being hit for some damage, and has been weighted accordingly.</p></td>

 **<span class="smallcaps">Combat End</span>**
---------------------------------------------

Combat ends when the outcome of the scene has been determined—you don’t
need to grind out all the health from opponents to know they are
defeated.

Once the direction of the Scene is determined, the Storyteller may drop
out of Combat and into a Narrative scene, letting the players resolve
combat as they see fit—or try to recuperate from its losses.

The Exalted are also known to stop combat through strange ways—such as
breaking the will of combatants so they no longer are their enemies.
Moments like this should be *encouraged*, and there is no special reason
that characters will keep attacking past reason.

### Fleeing

It is not unreasonable that one side or another will, instead of waiting
to be slaughtered, or outright surrender, they will instead try to flee
for their lives.

There are two methods to contest this. (Simply allowing one side or the
other to flee is also an option.)

One, is to transfer into an **Encounter**, where chasing or fleeing is
the goal of the encounter, and the Key Issues are impediments to
trapping or routing the fleeing characters.

The other is to attempt to keep the fleeing characters in combat. In
this case, all fleeing characters need to leave and external-facing
Zones through a contested Athletics roll on their turn.

Defeat
------

Characters who are knocked out of battle are typically not dead—they are
simply at the mercy of the opposing characters. Though, the Storyteller
should rightfully note the effects of various types of damages used,
such as slashing or piercing, and indicate that minor characters may
perish without active action.

Characters rarely fight to the death—or even to the point of being
knocked. Surrender, escape, or other options will become the pressing
concern of any NPC who gets at or below **5 Health.** They gain an
Intimacy of “survival” at this point.

Player characters who are defeated gain **1 Limit** from the
humiliation, regardless of if they are in mortal danger or not.

### <span class="smallcaps">Healing and Recovery</span>

Health lost in combat is regained much in the same way motes are:
through rest and relaxation. **15 Points** of Health are regained after
a full night’s rest, or **2 points** per hour if it is interrupted.

###  Cheat Death

A dramatic moment of death is a perfect send-off and ending for one of
the members of the Exalted. However, not all defeats are a dramatic
moment—sometime it is not time for a character to depart from the story.

The Player is the sole arbiter of the their character’s fate. If it is
not the time for their character’s story to end, that death becomes
cheated. Somehow, the defy the monumental odds, crawling days through
pain and anguish that none other have suffered for help.

But cheating death comes at a cost. The character will be invariably
changed from their experience. There will be scars of their
encounter—whether it is physical, mental, or social. The Player should
work with the Storyteller to come up with a consequence from the
implausible survival.

Suggestions are:

-   A dramatic change in Intimacies—such as the addition of (fear)
    related to the event.

-   A loss of an appropriate merit, such as an Ally who sacrificed
    themselves to save the character.

-   Physical reminders of the lost battles, such as scars.

-   Recurring nightmares, where the character is forced to relive the
    moment of their escaped death.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Antagonist Defeat</p>
<p>There will be times when an antagonist—intended to be recurring—is defeated, or otherwise dramatically halted.</p>
<p>These Characters, like Player Characters, have the ability to escape certain defeat if it best suits the plot. However, they should <em>also</em> suffer the same consequences for doing so.</p>
<p>Escaping death should never be cheap, and should not be done too many times. Let your Players have victories.</p></td>

 The Environment
---------------

The Environment itself can be a “character” involved in combat, as a way
to simulate things ranging from earthquakes to the turning of the night,
to things such as the advancement of a firestorm raging through a city.

The Environment is generally impervious to any attacks thrown at it (You
may throw water at a fire to repel its advances, but typically not
pierce it with arrows), and does not have a mind of its own to
coordinate.

If an Environmental “attack” is all encompassing in a Zone and
predictable, such as rumbling earth, a landslide, falling a great
distance, or a burning flame, there is *no need* to make an Attack roll.
It is assumed to hit and deal damage.

|                          |     |
|--------------------------|-----|
| **Environmental Damage** |     |
| Light                    | 3   |
| Medium                   | 5   |
| Heavy                    | 7   |
| Oppressive               | 9   |

Minor Characters
----------------

Minor Characters, especially those that cannot alone damage their foes
will naturally fall into **Battle Groups**.

Groups act as a single character, but gain the following bonus based on
their **Group Magnitude:**

-   Add 5 Health for every Magnitude Scale increment.

-   Add 1 Damage, 1 Accuracy, and +1 Dice on an action for every
    Magnitude Scale increment

 Equipment
---------

### Armor

-   **Light** armors are those that have been tailor made to aid in
    flexible movement—above and beyond what normal clothes will do.
    Typically, light armors will consisted of padded gloves, tightly
    wound fabrics, and other cushions to assist in acrobatic movements.

-   **Medium** and **Heavy** armors provide increasing Block protection,
    but at the cost of more limited mobility. Most traditional armors,
    such as breastplates, chain shirts, and articulated plate fit into
    the Medium or Heavy Category.

#### Custom Weapons

Custom weapons defy the Light, Medium, and Heavy categories, and are
instead built from the ground up (from 0) using Tags.

Mundane weapons have 3 points with which to spend on tags, while
Artifacts start with 6 points.

#### Special Tags

Special weapons, Powers or Martial Arts will grant specific tags to be

Elsewhere
---------

The mechanisms of reality are flawed. Items, particularly those not paid
attention to, have a tendency to reappear and move to alternate
locations. Mortals will often attribute this forgetfulness, or not
recognize the incongruity at all, when in reality it is the tireless
motions of the Loom taking shortcuts.

Exalts, long ago, learned how to quietly and easily exploit this—simply
though sleight of hand, they can store their physical items in places
and not feel the weight nor brunt of the equipment. It is not unusual
for an Exalt to suddenly pull out a large daiklaive from little more
than a handbag’s opening.

Sidereals have labeled this flaw as “Elsewhere,” since the items are
neither *here* nor *there*, but simply somewhere…else. Certainly it is
something that needs to be fixed. Eventually. Preferably by someone
else.

Elsewhere is not all-powerful. The Exalt must reasonably be able to
carry the items in the first place, and it must not be something that
has a particularly close and important tie to reality. For example:
living creatures cannot be kept in Elsewhere, as their mind and soul has
far too great of self-awareness to be forgotten by reality.

As well, while time does not affect items *inside* of Elsewhere, the
moment it is pulled out reality will quickly reassert itself. Food would
rot within seconds, and we iron rust within a blink of an eye.

Items stored in Elsewhere of a dead Exalt will eventually reassert
themselves into reality—often by finding themselves in nearby containers
that may not have existed until needed for this precise purpose.

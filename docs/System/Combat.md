Combat
======

The Time of Tumult is one of great conflict, and the Exalted that live
through it will invariably find themselves in armed conflict, weilding
their great weapons and powers of destruction.

Combat in Exalted focuses on the rythmn of battle, with characters
constantly testing each other, looking for openings, and strategizing
through Maneuvers, until they have built up enough Impulse to strike
with a Decisive Blow.

Combat Values
-------------

### Impulse

Impulse is a meaure of the current *tactical advantage* the character
has. The higher the value, the greater the control they have over the
battlefield.

Impulse is *gained* through Maneuvers—actions that turn the battlefield
in the character’s favor.

Impulse is then spent on Decisive Actions—actions that deal great
strikes of force upon their enemies.

Being that it is gained and spent exclusively during a combat scene,
physical tokens (such as coins or poker chips) are suggested to keep
track of Impulse.

### Static Values

-   **Endurance** *  
    *The measure of how energy and action the character has left in
    them. Once a character’s Endurance pool is exhausted through damage,
    they have lost the will and/or physical ability to keep fighting and
    will collapse in exhaustion.

-   **Defense Value (DV)** *  
    *Reflects the character’s ability to deflect, dodge, or otherwise
    mitigate an incoming attack.

-   **Evasion** *  
    *Represents the ability for characters to quickly move and respond
    to changes in the battlefield.

-   **Soak *  
    ***The hardiness of a character, the raw ability to take a hit
    without it affecting them at all.

-   **Accuracy  
    **The ability to land a hit with an attack. This value is highly
    dependant on the weapon used—for example, a short bow is a light
    archery weapon, so would use Dexterity, Archery, and provide an
    Accuracy Bonus. This is described in more detail in the
    [Weapons](/Combat/#weapons-and-armor) section.

-   **Base Damage***  
    *When a Decisive Attack lands, a portion of the of the dice pool
    comes from a player’s Base Damage—in essence, it is the minimium
    amount of power behind any striking attack.

-   **Initiative  
    **How quickly a character can react to the start of battle,
    determining their turn order as well as the starting amount of
    Impulse.

The Combat Round
----------------

Combat is split into distinct Rounds, where each character has a chance
to take one Action, such as Attacking, using a Charm, or a Maneuver.
Characters also may perfrom as many *unique* Free Actions as desired,
such as Movement, during their turn.

Turn order is determined by all character’s rolling a Chance Die (1d10),
and adding their **Initiative** score. The characters then proceed from
highest to lowest, then restarting the round once all characters have
gone.

If there is a tie of Initiative between a Player Character and a
Non-Player Character, the Player gets to choose who goes first. If there
is a tie between Player Characters, simply flip a coin.

Each combatant starts with a number of Impulse equal to their Initiative
score.

**Turn Order:** 1d10 + (Initiative)  
**Starting Impulse:** (Initiative)

All combatants are assumed to start combat ready: their weapons are
drawn, they have fallen into their Martial Arts, etc.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Balancing Large Groups</p>
<p>Player Characters only get One Action per round. But Non-Player Characters are not beholden to this rule. The Storyteller may choose to let a NPC have up to 3 actions per Round—if they are particularly powerful and dangerous foes.</p>
<p>The Rule of Thumb is to have antagonists acting no less than 1/3 of the Player actions.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Ambush Round

If characters are ambushed—not expecting combat in the least, they must
suffer through an Ambush Round.

Instead of starting combat as normal, Ambushed characters instead start
with **0 Impulse**, and may only act *after* all other characters have
acted, regardless of their Turn Order. Once the Ambush Round ends,
normal turn order resumes.

Ambushes are premeditated affairs--requiring setup, planning, and
coordination between the party. Players cannot suddenly go into combat
if things are not going their way and declare it an Ambush.

Player Character always get a Reflexive (Cunning + Awareness) roll to
individually avoid becoming Ambushed.

### Holding Action

Characters may choose to Hold their Action, waiting for something to
happen in order to respond to it.Players must describe what it is they
are waiting for—they cannot arbitrarily wait.

When the specified event happens, they must spend **2 Impulse,** and
then take their action as desired, (either before or after the specified
event, at their choice)

If the event does not happen in the Round, the Player loses their
action. (But they do not need to spend the Impulse).

### Change Initiative

As a Free Action, you may increase your Initiative Turn Order, by
spending 1 Impulse per +1 to Initiative. This takes effect at the start
of the next Round.

Maneuvers
---------

A Maneuver is any action the character performs to gain advantage over
the scene—be it to test the stance of their enemies, analyze the
battlefield for strategic advantage, or to intimidate your foes through
physical prowess.

The Player describes any action that would grant them tactical
advantage, and then rolls the \[Att + Abi\] dice pool. The Number of
Successes rolled is then gained as Impulse.

Remember, Exalted follows the dynamic and cinematic model—heroes should
be leaping across narrow banisters, dancing steel in testing feints, and
channelling their inner might during combat. Nearly any action, if
described well enough, can grant Impulse.

### Stunting Maneuvers

Stunts in a combat Maneuver not only grant +2 dice, they let the Player
choose an effect their Maneuver has on the battlefield, though their
roll must exceed the difficulty of the action.

As a reminder note: Stunts are special, interesting descriptions of a
character’s action. By their nature, they cannot be repeated over and
over again in the same scene.

Decisive Strike
---------------

Once the character has gained enough Impulse, they may expend it in a
Decisive Strike, aimed at knocking their enemy off the battlefield.

You must have 2 Impulse to perform a Decisive Strike.

Roll the **Accuracy** dice pool against the target’s DV. If the roll
fails, the attacker loses 2 Impulse and ends their turn.

On a success, take the Threshold Successes from the Accuracy Roll, the
character’s Base Damage, and *all* the Impulse they currently have to
form a Damage Dice Pool. The number of successes from that Dice Pool is
how much Endurance the target loses.

**Damage Pool**: (Impulse + Base Damage + Threshold Success)  
**Target Endurance lost:** \# Successes Rolled

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Flurry Strikes

The Player may target multiple characters with their decisive strike. To
do so, simply make an Accuracy Roll against the target with the
*highest* applicable defense.

Once damage has been calculated, it is spread out among all the targets
at the Player’s discretion. e.g. If 5 damage is rolled, they can decide
to place 1 on one target and 4 on another.

### Stunting Decisive Strikes

If the Player stunts during a Decisive Strike, they may choose to take a
Maneuver Stunt Effect on their Accuracy roll ***or*** they may try to
get a Decisive Strike Stunt Effect.

The stunt effect difficulty for Maneuver difficulty effects are based on
the Accuracy roll, wheras Decisive Strike difficulties are based on the
Damage roll.

Regardless, the +2 dice is applied to the Accuracy Roll.

Situational Defense 
-------------------

There are two levels of Situational Defenses in Exalted: **Partial** and
**Full**.

**Partial** means that the Attacking Player has a -3
Disadvantage--effectively increasing the defending Player’s DV by 3.

**Full** means that they cannot be attacked by mortal means.

Situational Defenses often can be countered by natural means: characters
can move across the battlefield, or scale a wall.

**Situational Defenses do not stack.** It is either Partial, or Full.
However, multiple defenses must often be addressed individually. If a
character is hiding behind a wall (Full) as well as at a distance
(Partial), if the wall is destroyed by an action, the Range Defense
would still apply.

### Cover

Characters may use the terrain to gain Situational Defenses, such as by
ducking against rubble or hiding behind a wall. Taking Cover is not an
assumed action: it is a specific **Secondary Action** that characters
may take.

Cover is considered **Partial** when at least half a character’s body is
blocked by a material that can withstand weapon blows--such as a
chest-high wall of broken stone rubble.

Cover is considered **Full** when the character’s entire body is
blocked, such as behind a wall.

Typically, cover works both ways: a character in Full Defense from
attacks is also blocked from attacking others for the same reason.

Range
-----

Range is the most prevalent and common source of Situational Defense, so
much so that it has special rules.

### Moving

Each Round, characters may take a Free Action to move one range band.

### Range Bands

Characters are constantly in motion during combat, running down
alleyways and leaping off tree limbs. Rather than rely on absolute
positioning, Exalted works off of *relative* positioning between
characters, divided into specific **Range Bands**.

Characters are assumed to keep in their same relative Range Band until
one side makes a deliberate effort to change it through a **Move
Action**.

Move Actions may also change relative range bands to other characters.
If moving towards a character in a group, all characters in that group
would be one range band closer. This secondary effect is dependent on
the Storyteller’s judgement.

There are Eight Range bands, split along Five Categories:

-   **Close (1x)  
    **Within arm’s reach.

-   **Short (1x)  
    **Within a few yards of each other--a distance able to be crossed
    within a quick sprint.

-   **Medium (2x)  
    **Far enough that conversations would have to be shouted, and an
    archer would have to take preparations for a proper attack.

-   **Long (3x)  
    **Across an entire field, far enough away that visual, rather than
    verbal, signals would have to be used.

-   **Far (1x)  
    **Term for “outside of the battlefield”. Characters cannot get *to*
    the Far Range band through Move actions, but any late-comers to the
    battle will show up at this Range Band.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Alternate Rules:<br />
Battlemaps and Absolute Positioning</strong></p>
<p>While relative Range Bands are the recommended method of playing Exalted, some players prefer to play with absolute positioning and battlemaps. If that is your preference, make the following changes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Distance will be measured in meters. Typically, hexagonal space (hex) will represent 5 meters.</p></li>
<li><p>Characters have a <strong>Speed</strong> Static value, which is 3 + (Dex + Athletics )/2.<br />
The distance travelled is Speed x5 meters--or (Speed) Hexes at a time.</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever the Move Action is taken, the character moves (Speed) hex.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>A Dash moves (Speed)x2.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>A character may move 5 meters (1 hex) on their action without taking a Move Action.</p></li>
<li><p>All references to (Range Band) as a distance is 25 meters (5 hexes).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The definition for range bands are altered:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>0-5 meters (0-1 hex): <strong>Close</strong></p></li>
<li><p>6-20 meters (2-5 hex): <strong>Short</strong></p></li>
<li><p>21-70 meters (6-15 hex): <strong>Medium</strong></p></li>
<li><p>71-145 meters (16-30 hex): <strong>Long</strong></p></li>
<li><p>146+ meters (31 hex): <strong>Far</strong></p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Close Attacks

**Close Attacks**, such as those made with **Melee** and **Brawl**, may
be made at Close Range with no defense applied, and at Close Range with
Partial Defense. Any further ranges enjoy a Full Defense.

-   **Close**: None (0)

-   **Short**: Partial (-3)

-   **Medium+**: Full (N/A)

Attacking a Short range (or further, with the right Powers) does not
change the relative range band. It is assumed that the character rushes
in, attacks, and then cannot hold the position for more than an instant.

### Ranged Attacks

**Ranged Attacks,** such as those made with **Archery** and **Thrown**
are made at Short Range with no defense. At Medium they suffer a Partial
Defense, whereas Long+ cannot be attacked at all.

**Ranged** attacks may take an **Aim** action to eliminate Range Partial
Defense of Medium+ attacks.

At **Close** range, ranged attacks are hampered by the control the
opponent has claimed over the area, and so also suffer a Partial
Defense. However, this defense *cannot* be countered with an **Aim**
action.

-   **Close**: Partial (-3)  
    Cannot use Aim action to counter.

-   **Short**: None (0)

-   **Medium:** Partial (-3)

-   **Long+:** Full (N/A)

Endurance
---------

Endurance is a value measuring how much fight a character has left in
them. Once a character’s Endurance Pool has been exhausted, either
through pain, disheartenment, or whatever means are employed, the
character is considered out of the battle.

### Defeat

Characters who are knocked out of battle are typically not dead--they
are simply at the mercy of the opposing characters.

Non-recurring antagonistic characters' fates should be left to the
players. Depending on the narrative type of damage (slashing, stabbing,
etc.) these minor characters may perish without aid.

#### Player Character Defeat

Any character that falls during battle gains **1 Limit**.

Death is only at the choice of the Player.

#### Recurring Antagonist Defeat

If they are intended to be a recurring antagonist, they should always
manage to get away, though suffering a major blow to their own
plans--they will often be forced to retreat and lick their wounds.

If you force a retreat on these Antagonists, you must bribe your players
each with a [**<u>Strife Point</u>**](/General_System/#strifes) as compensation.

Remember, though, that recurring antagonists can only be used so many
times--eventually you will have to move to the Final Confrontation,
where the fate of these antagonists should be placed into the Players’
hands.

#### Death and Dying

The death of any central characters to the story should be pivotal and
moving to the story. Player Characters will only die on defeat if it is
something the Player wishes for their character.

A dramatic moment of death is a perfect send-off and ending for one of
the members of the Exalted.

Likewise, central Non-Player Character deaths should be determined by
the Storyteller, although they must bribe all the Players with a
**Strife Point** to avoid such a fate--something that the Players are
allowed to reject should they so choose.

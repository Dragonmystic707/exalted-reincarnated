Combat
======

The Time of Tumult is one of great conflict, and the Exalted that live
through it will invariably find themselves in armed conflict, weilding
their great weapons and powers of destruction.

Combat in Exalted focuses on the rythmn of battle, with characters
constantly testing each other, looking for openings, and strategizing,
and then delivering decisive strikes to fell their foes.

Combat Overview
---------------

### Power

Impulse is a measure of the current *tactical advantage* the character
has. The higher the value, the greater the control they have over the
battlefield. Impulse is:

-   *Gained* through Maneuvers—actions that turn the battlefield in the
    character’s favor.

-   *Spent* on Decisive Actions—actions that deal great strikes of force
    upon their enemies.

Being that it is gained and spent exclusively during a combat scene,
physical tokens (such as coins or poker chips) are suggested to keep
track of Impulse.

### 

The Combat Round
----------------

Combat is split into distinct Rounds, where each character has a chance
to take one and only one Action, such as Attacking, using a Charm, or a
Maneuver. Any powers that take up a full action are denoted as
**Simple** Powers.

In addition to their simple Action, characters can Move and perform
other minor actions. These are called **Free Actions**, and as many Free
Actions may be performed on their turn at no consequence. The only
limitation is that each Free Action must be unique—you cannot take *two*
Move actions, for example, just one. (Without a Power, that is.)

Free Actions can be taken in an order—before or after the main Action of
the turn.

### Turn Order

Turn order is determined by the Initiative Roll:

**Initiative**: 1d10 + (Initiative)

The characters then proceed from highest to lowest, then restarting the
round once all characters have gone.

If there is a tie of Initiative between a Player Character and a
Non-Player Character, the Player gets to choose who goes first. If there
is a tie between Player Characters, simply flip a coin.

Each combatant starts with a number of Impulse equal to their Initiative
score.

**Starting Impulse:** (Initiative)

All combatants are assumed to start combat ready: their weapons are
drawn, they have fallen into their Martial Arts, etc.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Balancing Large Groups</p>
<p>Player Characters only get One Action per round. But Non-Player Characters are not beholden to this rule. The Storyteller may choose to let a NPC have up to 3 actions per Round—if they are particularly powerful and dangerous foes.</p>
<p>The Rule of Thumb is to have antagonists acting no less than 1/3 of the Player actions.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Ambush Round

If characters are ambushed—not expecting combat in the least, they must
suffer through an Ambush Round.

Ambushed characters:

-   Start with **0 Impulse**,

-   May only act *after* all other characters have acted, regardless of
    their Turn Order. Once the Ambush Round ends, normal turn order
    resumes.

Ambushes are premeditated affairs--requiring setup, planning, and
coordination between the party. Players cannot suddenly go into combat
if things are not going their way and declare it an Ambush.

To prevent being ambushed, Player Characters get a Reflexive (Wits +
Awareness) roll against the skill of those setting up the ambush.
Typically this would be a contested roll against (Wits + Stealth).

### Holding Action

Any character may Hold their Action, or wait to act based on something
that happens in the battlefield. To do so, the must spend **2 Impulse**
and describe what it is they are waiting for: they cannot arbitrarily
wait. When the specified event happens, they get a chance to act
*before* or *after* the event, at their discretion. Any action may be
held, be it a Maneuver, Decisive, or even Free Action.

If the event does not happen in the Round, the character regains their
spent 2 Impulse, but does not get a chance to act this Round.

### Change Initiative

As a Free Action, change your Turn Order. Either spend 1 Impulse per +1
Initiative gained, or drop down any number for free. This takes effect
at the start of the next Round.

 Maneuvers
---------

A Maneuver is any action the character performs to gain advantage over
the scene—be it to test the stance of their enemies, analyze the
battlefield for strategic advantage, or to intimidate your foes through
physical prowess.

The Player describes any action that would grant them tactical
advantage, and then rolls the \[Att + Abi\] dice pool. The Number of
Successes rolled is then gained as Impulse.

Remember, Exalted follows the dynamic and cinematic model—heroes should
be leaping across narrow banisters, dancing steel in testing feints, and
channelling their inner might during combat. Nearly any action, if
described well enough, can grant Impulse.

### Attack Maneuvers

Maneuvers also include a type of Attacks—but ones that are focused more
on putting your foe on edge, rather than dealing a killing blow. These
Manuever Attacks that hit (a roll above the DV), would only deal
superficial harm to the player: a cut on a cheek to dishearten and
surprise, a blow to the chest to knock back down.

Attack Maneuvers do not deal direct damage to any normal foe on the
battlefield.

### Attacking Lesser Foes

However, Attack Maneuvers *can* directly harm [Lesser
Foes](/System/Combat/#lesser-foes). Damage is the number of Successes from the
Maneuver, minus the DV of the Lesser Foe(s) targetted. The Player still
receives full Impulse from the Maneuver.

-   **Lesser Foe Damage:** (Maneuver Roll) - DV

### Maneuver Effects

By spending **1 Mote**, the

Stunts in a combat Maneuver not only grant +2 dice, they let the Player
choose an effect their Maneuver has on the battlefield (in addition to
gaining Impulse.)

These Stunt Maneuvers must make sense in the context of the action, and
must exceed the difficulty of the action with the roll to take effect.

As a reminder: Stunts are special, interesting descriptions of a
character’s action. By their very nature, *Stunt Effects cannot be
repeated over and over—*they would cease to be a Stunt.

The Stunt Effects should be treated as examples, not an exhausted list.
The one restriction is that a Stunt Effect **cannot deal damage.**

######### *The Night Caste crashes through the window, barrelling into the Ogre, forcing it to stumble back from the blow.*

######### Here, the Player is stunting a \[Dexterity + Athletics\] Maneuver with a Knockback effect. They have 10 dice, (+2 from the stunt), and roll 5 Successes. 

######### They immediately gain 5 Impulse for their Maneuver, regardless. Then, (since this is a Knockback), they compare their 5 Successes against the Ogre’s DV (4). The Ogre is knocked back as desired.

Decisive Strike
---------------

Once the character has gained enough Impulse, they may expend it in a
Decisive Strike, aimed at knocking their enemy off the battlefield.

You must have a minimum of 2 Impulse available to perform a Decisive
Strike, which cannot be spent on Powers or other effects until after the
Accuracy Roll.

Roll the **Accuracy** dice pool against the target’s DV. If the roll
fails, the attack misses and you lose 2 Impulse.

-   **Accuracy Pool:** (Attribute + Ability + Weapon Mod)

-   **Hit:** (Accuracy Roll) &gt;= Target DV.

On a success, take the Impulse on the character to form a Damage Dice
Pool. The number of successes from this Damage Pool, plus any Base
Damage the Exalt has, is how much Endurance the target loses.

The character is required to use *all* of their Impulse on a Decisive
attack

-   **Damage Pool:** (Impulse gathered)

-   **Damage Dealt:** (Damage Roll) + Base Damage

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Flurry Strikes

The Player may target multiple characters with their decisive strike. To
do so, simply make an Accuracy Roll against the target with the
*highest* applicable defense.

Once damage has been calculated, it is spread out among all the targets
at the Player’s discretion. e.g. If 5 damage is rolled, they can decide
to place 1 on one target and 4 on another.

Positioning
-----------

### Range Bands

Characters are constantly in motion during combat, running down
alleyways and leaping off tree limbs. Rather than rely on absolute
positioning, Exalted works off of *relative* positioning between
characters, represented through 4 normal Range Bands. These Range Bands
are traversed by taking a Move Action.

-   **Melee/Close**  
    Within arm’s reach, and where close combat abilities such as Melee
    (its namesake) and Brawl reside. Characters within Melee range are
    currently engaged in battle, and must take the special Move Action
    called **Disengage** to leave.

-   **Short**  
    Within a few yards of each other--a distance able to be crossed
    within a quick sprint.

-   **Medium**  
    Far enough that conversations would have to be shouted, and where
    archers and other ranged combat is naturally limited.

-   **Long**  
    Across an entire field, far enough away that visual, rather than
    verbal, signals would have to be used.

There is one additional Range Band that does not act normally:
**Extreme**. It cannot be reached by any normal means and simply
represents anything “outside of the battlefield.”

Anything in the Extreme Range band cannot be directly interacted with
during combat without specific Powers. Any reinforcements to the scene
will spend one Round in the Extreme Range Band before moving into the
conflict.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Maneuvers and Free Actions</p>
<p>Free Actions (namely Movement) can be incorporated into a Maneuver. Vaulting across the battlefield to get closer to the target is a perfectly valid Maneuver.</p>
<p>In these cases the Free Action is <em>combined</em> with the Maneuver, and still follows the same restrictions—namely that another Free Action of the same type cannot be made on the turn.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Attack Ranges

**Close Range** action, such as those made with Melee or Brawl, may only
be made while in Melee/Close Range.

**Ranged** Decisive Strikes, namely those made with Archery and Thrown,
may be made against all targets at Short or Medium range.

Ranged Strikes *may* be made against targets within Melee range, but
suffer (-2) successes to their Accuracy roll—as though the target had
Partial Cover.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Range and Maneuvers</p>
<p>By definition, Maneuver and their Stunts are dependent on judgment calls from the Storyteller.</p>
<p>Range only matters on Maneuvers that have contact between combatants—a character slamming into another is considered a Melee Attack, while dropping a chandelier on another would be considered a Ranged Attack.</p>
<p>Maneuvers that don’t have contact—such as analyzing the battlefield—don’t care about Range and can be performed regardless of distance. There may be other restrictions though: Intimidating an opponent by hurling insults can only work if the opponent can <em>hear</em> said insults, for example.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Movement
--------

The following are all considered to be sub-types of the Move Action:
Move, Dash, and Disengage. If one is taken during a Round, only that one
may be taken. (i.e. no Dashing and then Moving in the same Round).

All Move-type actions are Free Actions.

### Move

Move one Range Band closer or further away from a target. You may not
Move while in Melee Range of an enemy—instead you must take a Disengage
Action.

### Dash

A Dash cannot be made engaged in Melee Combat. Spend 2 Impulse, and
suffer -1 DV for a round to cross 2 Range Bands instead of 1.

Dash Movements cannot be taken two Rounds in a row.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Movement and Common Sense</strong></p>
<p>Movement towards or away from one character may affect the distance between others, and should be changed according to common sense. If a character is in a group and you move towards them, you also move closer to all characters in the group.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Disengage

In order to move away from Melee Range of an enemy combatant, the
character must Disengage. Spend 2 Impulse to attempt to move back to
Short Range.

Combatants currently in Melee Range may attempt to halt Disengagement.
Those that roll (Dex + Athletics) above your Evasion remain in Melee
Range—immediately joining you in your new position.

If an opponent that was successfully disengaged from tries to close into
Melee Range on the next round, reflexively move back to Short Range from
them. (This reflexive action does not count as a Move action.)

Situational Defenses
--------------------

There are two levels of Situational Defenses:

-   **Partial –** Provides +2 DV. This represents significant, but not
    impenetrable protection from attackers. Such as hiding behind
    pillars, standing in uneven terrain, or being surrounded by gale
    winds.

-   **Full** – Cannot be attacked while the defense is active. They are
    standing behind a full wall, across a giant chasm, or have become
    Immaterial.

Full Situational Defenses must be countered before the character can be
attacked. Some times it may be a simple mundane action, such as bursting
in the room behind the wall. But often certain charms, stunts or powers
will be required to counter or decrease the Defense by a level: Full to
Partial, or Partial to None.

### Cover

Cover is one of the most widely available Situational Defenses, as it
can be gained simply by ducking into the terrain of the scene.

Cover is considered **Partial** when at least half a character’s body is
blocked by a material that can withstand weapon blows--such as a
chest-high wall of broken stone rubble.

Cover is considered **Full** when the character’s entire body is
blocked, such as behind a wall.

Typically, cover works both ways: a character in Full Defense from
attacks is also blocked from attacking others for the same reason.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Alternate Rules:<br />
Battlemaps and Absolute Positioning</p>
<p>Sometimes a particular battle, or even the Player Group will prefer the tactical feel of minatures on a battlemap. This is perfectly fine, and it is simple enough to convert to Absolute Positioning with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A typical battlemap will use hexagonal spaces (hexes), each representing 5 meters.</p></li>
<li><p>Characters have a <strong>Speed</strong> value: 3 + (Dex+Athletics)/2</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A character can Move <strong>Speed</strong> Hexes (Speed x5 meters)</p></li>
<li><p>Dash is Speed x2 hexes (Speed x10 meters)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A character <em>may</em> move away from Melee/Close Range without Disengaging, but only at Half Speed.</p></li>
<li><p>A character that successfully contests a disengage action reflexively moves <em>halfway</em> towards the new location.</p></li>
<li><p>References to “Range Band” as a generic distance is 5 Hexes (25 meters)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The definition for Specific Range bands are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Melee/Close:</strong> 0-1 hex (0-5 m.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short:</strong> 2-5 hex (6-25 m.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Medium:</strong> 6-15 hex (26-75 m.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long:</strong> 61-30 hex (76-150 m.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extreme:</strong> 31+ hex (151+ m.)</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Lesser Foes
-----------

Lesser Foes are those that are below the power level of the main players
on the field.

Instead of attacking or defending, they will do special maneuvers to
slow down or harass combatants, *or* they will do Maneuvers to grant
their Greater Foe Ally Impulse.

Lesser Foes tend to group up into packs. “Individual targets” for this
purpose of Charms, Flurries, etc. refer to the group size magnitude, not
individuals numbers.

&lt;&lt;TODO&gt;&gt;

Endurance
---------

Endurance is a value measuring how much fight a character has left in
them. Once a character’s Endurance Pool has been exhausted, either
through pain, disheartening, or whatever means are employed, the
character is considered out of the battle.

### Regaining Endurance

A full day of rest—without dangerous interruption—will allow an Exalt to
regain their Endurance.

However, an Exalt’s life is dangerous, and they may not have the luxury
of a full day’s rest. In this case, they regain (Essence) Endurance
every hour since the last combat scene.

### Defeat

Characters who are knocked out of battle are typically not dead—they are
simply at the mercy of the opposing characters.

Non-recurring antagonistic characters’ fates should be left to the
players. Depending on the narrative type of damage (slashing, stabbing,
etc.) these minor characters may perish without aid.

#### Player Character Defeat

Any character that falls during battle gains **1 Limit**. Death is only
at the choice of the Player, but if the entire party falls the
Storyteller may impose a grand Complication onto their story.

#### Death and Dying

The death of any central characters to the story should be pivotal and
moving to the story. Player Characters will only die on defeat if it is
something the Player wishes for their character.

A dramatic moment of death is a perfect send-off and ending for one of
the members of the Exalted.

#### Recurring Antagonist Defeat

If they are intended to be a recurring antagonist, they should always
manage to get away, though suffering a major blow to their own
plans—they will often be forced to retreat and lick their wounds.

If you force a retreat on these Antagonists, you must bribe your players
each with a [**<u>Strife Point</u>**](strifes) as compensation.

Remember, though, that recurring antagonists can only be used so many
times—eventually you will have to move to the Final Confrontation, where
the fate of these antagonists should be placed into the Players’ hands.

 Armor and Weapons
-----------------

All combat equipment in Exalted is divided into four categories Light,
Medium, Heavy, and of course Unarmed/No Armor.

### Armor

The Category of Armor provides modifiers to the Soak or Evasion defenses
(and ultimately to DV).

-   **Light** armors are those that have been tailor made to aid in
    flexible movement—above and beyond what normal clothes will do.
    Typically, light armors will consisted of padded gloves, tightly
    wound fabrics, and other cushions to assist in acrobatic movements.

-   **Medium** and **Heavy** armors provide increasing Soak protection,
    but at the cost of more limited mobility. Most traditional armors,
    such as breastplates, chain shirts, and articulated plate fit into
    the Medium or Heavy Category

### Weapons

The category of **Weapon** provides accuracy and base damage bonuses—the
heavier the weapon, the more damage it does, but at the cost of
accuracy.

Weapons also determine which Attribute is used during an Accuracy
roll—whether it be focused more on Dexterity or Strength.

-   **Unarmed** and **Medium** weapons can be effectively used by those
    who favor Dexterity or Strength.

-   **Light** weapons rely only on fine, precise movements to find their
    targets, and so rely soley on Dexterity.

-   **Heavy** weapons rely primarily on stable, graceful moves with a
    pendulous weight. Strength alone controls where the weapon goes.

### Weapon Attributes

&lt;&lt;TODO&gt;&gt;

Weapons are associated with abilities, and a speciality of them. Swords
is a speciality of Melee. Weapons can cross specialities and even
abilities: a claymore can double as a Sword or Club. A Spear as a sword
or a thrown weapon.

### Artifacts

&lt;&lt;TODO&gt;&gt;

Artifacts combat equipment can get one of the following:

-   +1 Soak or Evasion (no more than +2 total)

-   +1 Accuracy

-   +1 Damage.

-   Use of non-standard Attribute or Ability

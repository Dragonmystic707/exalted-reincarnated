Combat
======

The Time of Tumult is one of great conflict, and the Exalted that live
through it will invariably find themselves in armed conflict, weilding
their great weapons and powers of destruction.

Combat in Exalted focuses on the rythmn of battle, with characters
constantly testing each other, looking for openings, and strategizing
through Maneuvers, until they have built up enough Impulse to strike
with a Decisive Blow.

Combat Values
-------------

### Impulse

Impulse is a meaure of the current *tactical advantage* the character
has. The higher the value, the greater the control they have over the
battlefield.

Impulse is *gained* through Maneuvers—actions that turn the battlefield
in the character’s favor.

Impulse is then spent on Decisive Actions—actions that deal great
strikes of force upon their enemies.

Being that it is gained and spent exclusively during a combat scene,
physical tokens (such as coins or poker chips) are suggested to keep
track of Impulse.

### Static Values

-   **Endurance**  
    The measure of how energy and action the character has left in them.
    Once a character’s Endurance pool is exhausted through damage, they
    have lost the will and/or physical ability to keep fighting and will
    collapse in exhaustion.

-   **Defense Value (DV)**  
    Reflects the character’s ability to deflect, dodge, or otherwise
    mitigate an incoming attack.

-   **Evasion**  
    Represents the ability for characters to quickly move and respond to
    changes in the battlefield.

-   **Soak**  
    The hardiness of a character, the raw ability to take a hit without
    it affecting them at all.

-   **Accuracy**  
    The ability to land a hit with an attack. This value is highly
    dependant on the weapon used—for example, a short bow is a light
    archery weapon, so would use Dexterity, Archery, and provide an
    Accuracy Bonus. This is described in more detail in the
    [Weapons](/Combat/#weapons-and-armor) section.

-   **Base Damage**  
    When a Decisive Attack lands, a portion of the of the dice pool
    comes from a player’s Base Damage—in essence, it is the minimium
    amount of power behind any striking attack.

-   **Initiative**  
    How quickly a character can react to the start of battle,
    determining their turn order as well as the starting amount of
    Impulse.

The Combat Round
----------------

Combat is split into distinct Rounds, where each character has a chance
to take one and only one Action, such as Attacking, using a Charm, or a
Maneuver. Any powers that take up a full action are denoted as
**Simple** Powers.

In addition to their simple Action, characters can Move and perform
other minor actions. These are called **Free Actions**, and as many Free
Actions may be performed on their turn at no consequence. The only
limitation is that each Free Action must be unique—you cannot take *two*
Move actions, for example, just one. (Without a Power, that is.)

Free Actions can be taken in an order—before or after the main Action of
the turn.

Talking is considered a Free Action, and is actively encouraged—it fits
the genre.

### Turn Order

Turn order is determined by all character’s rolling a Chance Die (1d10),
and adding their **Initiative** score. The characters then proceed from
highest to lowest, then restarting the round once all characters have
gone.

If there is a tie of Initiative between a Player Character and a
Non-Player Character, the Player gets to choose who goes first. If there
is a tie between Player Characters, simply flip a coin.

Each combatant starts with a number of Impulse equal to their Initiative
score.

**Turn Order:** 1d10 + (Initiative)  
**Starting Impulse:** (Initiative)

All combatants are assumed to start combat ready: their weapons are
drawn, they have fallen into their Martial Arts, etc.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Balancing Large Groups</p>
<p>Player Characters only get One Action per round. But Non-Player Characters are not beholden to this rule. The Storyteller may choose to let a NPC have up to 3 actions per Round—if they are particularly powerful and dangerous foes.</p>
<p>The Rule of Thumb is to have antagonists acting no less than 1/3 of the Player actions.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Ambush Round

If characters are ambushed—not expecting combat in the least, they must
suffer through an Ambush Round.

Instead of starting combat as normal, Ambushed characters instead start
with **0 Impulse**, and may only act *after* all other characters have
acted, regardless of their Turn Order. Once the Ambush Round ends,
normal turn order resumes.

Ambushes are premeditated affairs--requiring setup, planning, and
coordination between the party. Players cannot suddenly go into combat
if things are not going their way and declare it an Ambush.

Player Character always get a Reflexive (Cunning + Awareness) roll to
individually avoid becoming Ambushed. The difficulty is based on the
skill of the Ambush characters (e.g. Cunning + Sneak).

### Holding Action

Characters may choose to Hold their Action, waiting for something to
happen in order to respond to it. Players must describe what it is they
are waiting for—they cannot arbitrarily wait. Any action may be held—be
it a Maneuver, Decisive, or Free Action.

When the specified event happens, they must spend **2 Impulse,** and
then take their action as desired, (either before or after the specified
event, at their choice)

If the event does not happen in the Round, the Player loses their
action. (But they do not need to spend the Impulse).

### Change Initiative

As a Free Action, change your Turn Order. Either spend 1 Impulse per +1
Initiative gained, or drop down any number for free. This takes effect
at the start of the next Round.

Maneuvers
---------

A Maneuver is any action the character performs to gain advantage over
the scene—be it to test the stance of their enemies, analyze the
battlefield for strategic advantage, or to intimidate your foes through
physical prowess.

Maneuvers also include a type of Attack—but ones that are focused more
on putting your foe on edge, rather than dealing a killing blow. These
Manuever Attacks that hit (a roll above the DV), would only deal
superficial harm to the player: a cut on a cheek to dishearten and
surprise, a blow to the chest to knock back down. Ultimate, the target’s
Endurance pool is not harmed.

The Player describes any action that would grant them tactical
advantage, and then rolls the \[Att + Abi\] dice pool. The Number of
Successes rolled is then gained as Impulse.

Remember, Exalted follows the dynamic and cinematic model—heroes should
be leaping across narrow banisters, dancing steel in testing feints, and
channelling their inner might during combat. Nearly any action, if
described well enough, can grant Impulse.

### Stunting Maneuvers

Stunts in a combat Maneuver not only grant +2 dice, they let the Player
choose an effect their Maneuver has on the battlefield (in addition to
gaining Impulse.)

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Maneuvers and Free Actions</strong></p>
<p>Free Actions can be encorporated into a Maneuver. Vaulting across the battlefield to get closer to the target is a perfectly valid Maneuver.</p>
<p>In these cases the Free Action is <em>combined</em> with the Maneuver, and still follows the same restrictions—namely that another Free Action of the same type cannot be made on the turn.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

These Stunt Maneuvers must make sense in the context of the action, and
must exceed the difficulty of the action with the roll to take effect.

As a reminder: Stunts are special, interesting descriptions of a
character’s action. By their nature, they *cannot* be repeated over and
over again in the same scene.

The Stunt effects should be treated as examples, not an exhausted list.

*The Night Caste crashes through the window, barrelling into the Ogre,
forcing it to stumble back from the blow.*

Here, the Player is stunting a \[Dexterity + Athletics\] Maneuver with a
Knockback effect. They have 10 dice, (+2 from the stunt), and roll 5
Successes.

They immediately gain 5 Impulse for their Maneuver, regardless. Then,
(since this is a Knockback), they compare their 5 Successes against the
Ogre’s DV (4). The Ogre is knocked back as desired.

Decisive Strike
---------------

Once the character has gained enough Impulse, they may expend it in a
Decisive Strike, aimed at knocking their enemy off the battlefield.

You must have a minimum of 2 Impulse available to perform a Decisive
Strike.

Roll the **Accuracy** dice pool against the target’s DV. If the roll
fails, the attack misses and you lose 2 Impulse.

On a success, take the Threshold Successes from the Accuracy Roll, the
character’s Base Damage, and *all* the Impulse they currently have to
form a Damage Dice Pool. The number of successes from that Dice Pool is
how much Endurance the target loses.

**Damage Pool**: (Impulse + Base Damage + Threshold Success)  
**Target Endurance lost:** \# Successes Rolled

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Flurry Strikes

The Player may target multiple characters with their decisive strike. To
do so, simply make an Accuracy Roll against the target with the
*highest* applicable defense.

Once damage has been calculated, it is spread out among all the targets
at the Player’s discretion. e.g. If 5 damage is rolled, they can decide
to place 1 on one target and 4 on another.

### Stunting Decisive Strikes

If the Player stunts during a Decisive Strike, they gain +2 dice to
their Accuracy Roll, and they have access to more powerful **Decisive
Stunt Effects.**

These Stunt Effects have a higher bar to clear, and the difficulty is
based around the *Damage Roll*.

The Player may decide to use the lesser Maneuver Stunt Effect in place
of a Decisive Stunt Effect, but still must use the Damage Roll.

Positioning
-----------

### Range Bands

Characters are constantly in motion during combat, running down
alleyways and leaping off tree limbs. Rather than rely on absolute
positioning, Exalted works off of *relative* positioning between
characters, represented through 4 normal Range Bands. These Range Bands
are traversed by taking a Move Action.

-   **Melee/Close**  
    Within arm’s reach, and where close combat abilities such as Melee
    (its namesake) and Brawl reside. Characters within Melee range are
    currently engaged in battle, and must take the special Move Action
    called **Disengage** to leave.

-   **Short**  
    Within a few yards of each other--a distance able to be crossed
    within a quick sprint.

-   **Medium**  
    Far enough that conversations would have to be shouted, and where
    archers and other ranged combat is naturally limited.

-   **Long**  
    Across an entire field, far enough away that visual, rather than
    verbal, signals would have to be used.

There is one additional Range Band that does not act normally:
**Extreme**. It cannot be reached by any normal means and simply
represents anything “outside of the battlefield.”

Anything in the Extreme Range band cannot be directly interacted with
during combat without specific Powers. Any reinforcements to the scene
will spend one Round in the Extreme Range Band before moving into the
conflict.

### Attack Ranges

**Close Range** actions—such as those made with Melee or Brawl—may only
be made while in Melee/Close Range.

**Ranged** Decisive Strikes—namely those made with Archery and
Thrown—may be made against all targets within Short, or Medium range.

Ranged Strikes *may* be made against targets within Melee range, but
suffer (-2) successes to their Accuracy roll—as though the target had
Partial Cover.

Movement
--------

The following are all considered to be sub-types of the Move Free
action: Move, Dash, and Disengage. If one is taken during a Round, only
that one may be taken. (i.e. no Dashing and then Moving in the same
Round).

### Move

As a Free Action, move one Range Band closer or further away from a
target. You may not Move while in Melee Range of an enemey—instead you
must take a Disengage Action.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Movement and Common Sense</strong></p>
<p>Movement towards or away from one character may affect the distance between others, and should be changed according to common sense. If a character is in a group and you move towards them, you also move closer to all characters in the group.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Dash

A Dash cannot be made while in Melee Range of an Enemy. Spend 2 Impulse,
and suffer -1 DV for a round to cross 2 Range Bands instead of 1.

Dash Movements cannot be taken two rounds in a row.

### Disengage

In order to move away from Melee Range of an enemy combatant, the
character must Disengage. Spend 2 Impulse to attempt to move back to
Short Range.

Combatants currently in Melee Range may attempt to halt Disengagement.
Those that roll (Dex + Athletics) above your Evasion remain in Melee
Range—immediately joining you in your new position.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Alternate Rules:<br />
Battlemaps and Absolute Positioning</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes a particular battle, or even the Player Group will prefer the tactical feel of minatures on a battlemap. This is perfectly fine, and it is simple enough to convert to Absolute Positioning with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A typical battlemap will use hexagonal spaces (hexes), each representing 5 meters.</p></li>
<li><p>Characters have a <strong>Speed</strong> value: 3 + (Dex+Athletics)/2</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A character can Move <strong>Speed</strong> Hexes (Speed x5 meters)</p></li>
<li><p>Dash is Speed x2 hexes (Speed x10 meters)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A character <em>may</em> move away from Melee/Close Range without Disengaging, but only at Half Speed.</p></li>
<li><p>References to “Range Band” as a distance is 5 Hexes (25 meters)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The definition for range bands are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Melee/Close:</strong> 0-1 hex (0-5 m.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short:</strong> 2-5 hex (6-20 m.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Medium:</strong> 6-15 hex (21-70 m.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long:</strong> 61-30 hex (71-145 m.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extreme:</strong> 31+ hex (146+ m.)</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Cover and Situational Defense
-----------------------------

There are two levels of Situational Defenses in Exalted: **Partial** and
**Full**.

**Partial** means that the Attacking Player has a -2
Disadvantage--effectively increasing the defending Player’s DV by 2.

**Full** means that they cannot be attacked by mortal means.

Situational Defenses often can be countered by natural means: characters
can move across the battlefield, or scale a wall.

**Situational Defenses do not stack.** It is either Partial, or Full.
However, multiple defenses must often be addressed individually. If a
character is hiding behind a wall (Full) as well as at a distance
(Partial), if the wall is destroyed by an action, the Range Defense
would still apply.

### Cover

Characters may use the terrain to gain Situational Defenses, such as by
ducking against rubble or hiding behind a wall.

Cover is considered **Partial** when at least half a character’s body is
blocked by a material that can withstand weapon blows--such as a
chest-high wall of broken stone rubble.

Cover is considered **Full** when the character’s entire body is
blocked, such as behind a wall.

Typically, cover works both ways: a character in Full Defense from
attacks is also blocked from attacking others for the same reason.

Environmental Effects
---------------------

&lt;&lt;TODO&gt;&gt;

Endurance
---------

Endurance is a value measuring how much fight a character has left in
them. Once a character’s Endurance Pool has been exhausted, either
through pain, disheartenment, or whatever means are employed, the
character is considered out of the battle.

### Defeat

Characters who are knocked out of battle are typically not dead--they
are simply at the mercy of the opposing characters.

Non-recurring antagonistic characters' fates should be left to the
players. Depending on the narrative type of damage (slashing, stabbing,
etc.) these minor characters may perish without aid.

#### Player Character Defeat

Any character that falls during battle gains **1 Limit**.

Death is only at the choice of the Player.

#### Death and Dying

The death of any central characters to the story should be pivotal and
moving to the story. Player Characters will only die on defeat if it is
something the Player wishes for their character.

A dramatic moment of death is a perfect send-off and ending for one of
the members of the Exalted.

#### Recurring Antagonist Defeat

If they are intended to be a recurring antagonist, they should always
manage to get away, though suffering a major blow to their own
plans--they will often be forced to retreat and lick their wounds.

If you force a retreat on these Antagonists, you must bribe your players
each with a [**<u>Strife Point</u>**](/General_System/#strifes) as compensation.

Remember, though, that recurring antagonists can only be used so many
times--eventually you will have to move to the Final Confrontation,
where the fate of these antagonists should be placed into the Players’
hands.

Spells
======

Summon Demon
------------

Summon Demon need only be purchased once as a spell, but may be used to
summon greater demons as the Sorcerer becomes initiated into higher
circles.

#### First Circle Summoning

**Cost:** 8sm; Ritual  
**Mins:** Sorcery 1

Summoning of the First Circle demons must be done with a demon’s name
class (such as “Blood Ape Pack”), and is a ritual lasting 1 hour, ending
at the moment of sundown.

A demon of the First Circle is summoned and bound to a particular task.
The Sorcerer must make a deal with the bound demon for this task,
suffering the equivalent of a **Minor** **Complication** as a way to
bargain with the Demon, otherwise it will return back to whence it came.

In return, the Sorcerer tasks the Demon with a change worth **2 RES** or
less, which they will do for at most one Month. Anything from “digging a
tunnel” to “Entertain guests.” However, summoning does not inherently
grant the demon the ability to *do* such things.

The Sorcerer cannot have more than (Essence)x2 active Summoned Demons
(or groups of demons) at a time.

Demons, once their agreement has been made, will follow both the spirit
and the letter of their binding. Additionally, they are bound to not
harm their Summoner. In other words, demons can be assumed to be loyal
to their summoner and are generally not interested in trying to
creatively break out of the bindings.

However, Demons should always be considered to be *alien* in mind, not
understanding much of how mortals and their summoner think. A Blood Ape
will not think twice about instantly choosing to murder someone instead
of politely shooing them away, were the Sorcerer to ask them to “prevent
people from disturbing me”.

#### Second Circle Summoning

**Cost:** 12sm; Ritual  
**Mins:** Sorcery 3

Once inducted into the Second Circle of Sorcery, the Sorcerer may summon
Second Circle Demons. This may only be done on the night of the New
Moon.

Second Circle Demons may make changes up to **5 RES** upon the world.

Second Circle Demons must be bargained with a task that will cause the
summoner to take a **Moderate Complication**. If failed or refused, the
Second Circle Demon often return peacefully from whence they came, but
the more belligerent may try to break their summoning bonds and even
attack the Sorcerer.

The Sorcerer may have only (Essence) Second Circle Demons (or pack of
demons) summoned at a time.

#### Third Circle Summoning

**Cost:** 15sm; Ritual  
**Mins:** Sorcery 5

Once inducted into the Third Circle of Sorcery, the greatest demons may
be summoned, though this may be done only on the first night of
Calibration, which comes once a year.

Third Circle Demons may make vast and wide-ranging changes to the world,
up to **15 RES** in scale.

Bargaining with a Third Circle Demon requires a **Major Complication**.
To fail or refuse is to let the demon free for the remaining four nights
of Calibration, a disaster in the making.

Only 1 Third Circle Demon can be summoned at a time.

First Circle
------------

### Coin of Distant Vision

**Cost:** 5sm  
**Mins:** Sorcery 1

When learning this Spell, the Sorcerer coalesces their flows of essence
around a shard of obsidian, entwining their senses with it, regardless
of its distance.

The Sorcerer may choose to peer their the obsidian shard as though it
were their own senses. If the shard is in a small container, such as a
pocket or pouch, they may sense beyond with a (-2) disadvantage.

The Sorcerer may remotely disentangle their sense from the obsidian
shard as a Secondary Action. This will require them to craft a new
connection to a new shard, which typically takes an evening to do. Only
one shard may be used at a time.

### Corrupted Words

**Cost:** 5sm; **Mins:** Sorcery 2  
**Duration:** One Year  
The Sorcerer coalesces a mass of all taboo words and topics into a small
egg-shaped mass in their hands, and whispers into it a new topic that
shall be bound with its unspoken peers. This could be something as
specific as “Secret Letters you will write to me” or as general as “The
Existence of the Sidereal Exalted.”  
On a successful (Intelligence + Sorcery) roll vs. Resolve a target, and
while close enough to physically do so, the Sorcerer may force this ball
of unspoken words down the throat of the target, binding their words on
the now taboo topic.

The now bound words will become impossible for the target to communicate
to another being--be it through words, written letters, or any other
such method. Attempting to do so will cause a vision of a mass of
writhing, repulsive maggots (or whatever else the target finds
repulsive) crawling from their mouth.

The Sorcerer may affect no more than (Essence) targets with this spell
at a time, and may choose to discontinue their charges at will.

### Theft of Memory

**Cost:** 5sm; **Mins:** Sorcery 2  
**Duration:** Indefinite

Focusing on a specific, known memory, the Sorcerer makes a (Cunning +
Sorcery) roll vs the Target’s Guile.

If successful, they place an pure-cut emerald (Resources 2) on the
forehead of their target, and siphon the memory away into the gem. The
target may no longer relive the memory. Anyone with the gem may spend
1m, clasp it to their forehead and relive it.

The Sorcerer, casting this spell again, may pull the memory out of the
emerald, where it will return back to its original owner.

Structure
---------

The system of Exalted Reincarnated consists of the base Narrative
System, Character Abilities, and three important subsystems: Encounters,
Combat, and Projects.

### Narrative System

The **Base Narrative System** covers the base interactions of the game,
and will most likely span the majority of time spent. It consists of
Action Rolls, Character Powers, as well as detailing out certain
specific circumstances that might come up, such as group rolls.

For the most part, the Base Narrative System is intended to provide
tools to quickly resolve what happens in response to roleplay with a
simple roll—something to verify that the characters can actually do what
they say they are doing.

These are all intended to be tools—something you can pick up and put
down as needed. Do not feel bound to use them if they are not needed.

### Encounters

The **Encounter** subsystem is a framework that the Storyteller can use
to provide twists, turns, and satisfying motion for dramatic scenes,
ranging from courtrooms to mental mazes to the intricate dance of social
maneuvering.

The Encounter subsystem is the lightest of the systems, intended to be
flexible enough to handle a myriad of possibilities while still
retaining structure and predictability.

### Combat

While a conflict could be determined by a simple opposed roll, it is
rarely satisfying to do so. The **Combat** subsystem is provided for
scenes where violence must be performed in glorious battle.

It is the most mechanically involved of the subsystems, in order to give
Players the satisfaction of performing shifting tactics and powerful
maneuvers that only the Exalted are capable of performing—while not
getting bogged down in endless minutia.

### Projects

Sometimes there are great stretches of times that pass by, that are not
directly played. Yet the Exalted are constantly busy, creatures of
action and motion even if there is not a direct outward change.

The **Project** subsystem details how to handle timeskips, background
tasks, and how the Exalt changes the world around them when the world
isn’t directly falling apart.

 Core Mechanics
--------------

### Action Rolls

Whenever an Exalt attempts something that is dangerous, uncertain, or
momentous, the Player at the table will perform an *Action Roll* to
check that the action can be performed.

Exalted uses a *dice pool* system, where the Player gathers a number of
d10’s (ten-sided dice) equal to their character’s relevant Attribute and
Ability scores. For example, if the character was attempting to scale a
cliff, they would gather a combination of their *Attribute: Strength
(4)* and *Ability: Athletics (2)* dice together into their Dice Pool.
(6, in this case).

Then, with their full Dice Pool, they roll. For each die face that is
showing the target number: **(7)** or higher, they gain one success on
the action. If the number of successes is higher than the difficulty of
the action, the character succeeds.

For example, examine the results of six rolled dice:

**{1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 9}**

This would count as 3 successes, as follows:

**{0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1}**

If the difficulty of the action was **3** or less, the character would
succeed on their action. The values of 1, 3, and 4 are not, and do not
affect the roll in any way.

If a die face shows up as the value **(10)**, the die generates not one
(1), but *two (2)* successes, allowing for critical successes beyond the
character’s normal limit.

If the roll had instead been:

**{1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10}**

This would count as (4) successes:

**{0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2}**

### When to call for a roll

An Action Roll should only be called for by the Storyteller when the
result of a character’s action is *uncertain*. Don’t call for a roll if
a task is either guaranteed to succeed or to fail—one of easiest traps
to fall into as a Storyteller is to call for a roll expecting it to
succeed or not, and then scrambling to adapt because the dice did
something unexpected.

### Retrying Rolls

Once a roll has been decided, a Player cannot simply try the action
again—it is assumed that the character has already approached the issue
from multiple different angles before truly failing in the roll. For
example, their failed barter included multiple tiers of money that they
were willing to part with.

Only through powers like a Charm, or by a dramatic change of the scene
is a re-roll allowed—for example, the marketplace erupting in a great
conflict, convincing the merchant that they need to sell and leave as
quickly as possible.

### Determining Difficulty

*Before a roll is performed*, the Storyteller should determine the
**Difficulty** of the roll—the number of successes that the roll must
match or exceed for the action to be considered a success. Here is a
guiding scale for choosing difficulties:

-   **Difficulty 1 (Easy)  
    **This task is challenging to a mere mortal, but an Exalted Hero is
    more than likely going to pass it: though there is still a
    reasonable risk of failing. Picking a lock, calming an irate
    guardsman, or basic first aid would fall under this category.

-   **Difficulty 3 (Typical)**- A mortal will find this to be a
    difficult or challenging task, but an Exalt will most likely be able
    to pass it with some effort.

-   **Difficulty 5** **(Difficult)**- Tasks which are daunting fall in
    this category—climbing a sheer cliff in winds, charming a staunch
    Dynast with sweet words, or avoiding the bite of a venomous beast.

-   **Difficulty 7 (Challenging)**- Tasks which should be
    near-impossible for any mortal. Such as noticing things in pitch
    darkness, or landing on a precise spot hundreds of feet below.

-   **Difficulty 9 (Impossible)**- Tasks a mortal could not possibly do,
    no matter the circumstances. Running straight up a building, leaping
    across a chasm unassisted, or keeping a patient alive without a
    heart for hours at a time with their bare hands.

**Difficulty 3** should be the default roll.

### What to Roll?

A roll should be called *in response* to Player actions, and as a way to
*represent* what is happening in the action—this is a role-playing game
after all!

The Attribute and Ability should be chosen based on what most represents
the action the Player’s character is described as doing.

For example, if a character was charming a crowd through song, it would
be *Charisma* and *Performance*.

A character’s Attribute represents the character’s general skills and
method, whether it is primarily a *Physical, Social,* or *Mental*
action, and if they are performing the action that action through
*Force,* or *Finesse*. The six Attributes are:

-   **Strength** (Physical Force)

-   **Dexterity** (Physical Finesse)

-   **Charisma** (Social Force)

-   **Insight** (Social Finesse)

-   **Intelligence** (Mental Force)

-   **Wits** (Mental Finesse)

Abilities are *specific* skills relevant to the situation, such as
*Lore* for knowledge of history, or *Craft* for the creation of material
goods. A full description and list of Abilities may be found in the
[Attributes and Abilities](attributes-and-abilities) chapter.

It is also perfectly acceptable to offer a selection of multiple
different Abilities that might match the action, with the Player having
the choice between them.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Failing Forward</strong></p>
<p>In a high-powered setting such as Exalted, properly handling failure is incredibly important. You, as the Storyteller, are there to make sure that the story keeps moving forward, even if the Players are unable to do so.</p>
<p>It is often helpful to see a failed roll as an opportunity for you to move the plot in a way that the Player characters wouldn’t want, rather than simply not succeeding.</p>
<p>When a Player Character fails on an action, there are a few general paths that you may choose to employ:</p>
<p><strong>A Simple Failure</strong></p>
<p>The character doesn’t do the action, and the story must continue through a different way.</p>
<p>Sometimes simply failing is perfectly fine—the limits of the character are tested and shown, and there’s no shame in slowing down and reconsidering a new way to go forward.</p>
<p>This is the simplest way forward, and probably what most people think of with a failure. Using it should happen when the Players have plenty of potential options in front of them and can quickly jump tracks onto another way—often highlighting a different character.</p>
<p>The dangers of this path, though, is that it will slow down momentum of the game. A little slowdown is fine—sometimes there needs to be room to breathe—but if a game crashes to a halt based on a failure and all narrative momentum is lost, it would be better to choose a different failure condition.</p>
<p><strong>A Great Cost</strong></p>
<p>The character manages to do what they intended, but only at a great personal or story cost—they have met the bare minimum of what they wanted, but most definitely not in the way they wanted it.</p>
<p>They opened the doors like the wanted, but they alerted everyone to their actions. You, as the Storyteller, are allowed to take a story-based reaction against the player character, driving up the stakes of the scene. Remember: you are not there to punish the players, but to set up great adversity and challenges!</p>
<p><strong>No, but...</strong></p>
<p>If players have heavily invested in an action, and it just doesn’t work out because of bad luck, don’t give them <em>nothing</em>. Sure, they failed at the task they were intending, but another pathway opens.</p>
<p>Maybe they failed to convince the Queen of their plight, but the Prince overheard and wishes to speak to them. Be judicious of choosing this option, as overuse may make your game feel consequence-free.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 Advantages and Disadvantages
----------------------------

The difficulty of an action can be modified by various conditions,
whether it be environmental, helpful, or antagonistic. These should be
provided by the Storyteller as deemed appropriate to the narrative.

By default, Advantages and Disadvantages are written in terms of
**dice** available for the character to roll: (+2/-2 dice). Since this
is the default, the “dice” moniker is often dropped—if a power ever
simply says “+2”, it means to dice.

Whenever a Modifier affects a static value, such as Resolve or
Difficulty, you should **take the average**, rounding up. +1 or +2 dice
is +1 to Resolve, for example. Some powers will directly reference
Static Value or Difficulty modifiers, instead of dice.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Minimum Difficulty</strong></p>
<p>The minimum difficulty is <strong>always 1</strong>. You cannot lower difficulty past that through any means. Therefore, rolling 0 successes is <strong>always a failure</strong>.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Assigning Modifiers

Modifiers can be granted from any source, such as any powers, the
environment, or even the mental condition of the character taking the
action.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><blockquote>
<p><strong>Advantage/Disadvantage</strong></p>
</blockquote></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p><strong>Dice</strong></p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p><strong>Difficulty</strong></p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><blockquote>
<p>Moderate</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td>±2</td>
<td>±1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><blockquote>
<p>Major</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>±4</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>±2</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Any **Modifier** should be something significant to the scene—something
that would perturb even an Exalt, and you should not concern yourself
with keeping track of anything and everything that *could* be a
modifier. Light rain, while thematic and aesthetic, would not be enough
to affect the athletics skill of the Exalt.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Natural Modifiers and Difficulty</p>
<p>Remember that Difficulty has its own inbuilt assumptions—many difficulties are set because they are a particular “base” level of challenge with a specific disadvantage: picking a difficult lock (3) vs. picking a difficult lock while blindfolded in a hurricane (9).</p>
<p>If a character uses a charm or power to dismiss part of that difficulty—removing all impairments caused by weather— it is the same as granting them an equivalent Advantage!</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 Stunting
--------

The setting of Exalted encourages wild, ambitious, and perhaps dangerous
actions of the characters. When a player describes their character doing
their action in a fun and creative way, the Storyteller should reward
them by letting the action proceed! If a character swings from a
chandelier in order to drop down on top of an enemy, let them do so!

Stunts should operate off of the “Rule of Cool,” and may bend the rules
a bit, both of reality and the game—such as falling great distances to
land perfectly in a pose with no damage. Nobody need concern themselves
with the useless physics of such a maneuver.

If the Stunt is particularly impressive consider rewarding the Player
with [1 Anima](/System/The System/#anima).

Stunts also do not need to be tied to specific actions. If, as a
Storyteller, you find a scene or particular interaction to be moving,
reward the players with Anima.

Excellencies
------------

Exalts aren’t restricted to simply accepting the roll that is given to
them. When they need to, they may activate their Exalt-specific
Excellency to push their roll further than they thought they could, both
before they perform the roll, or after the roll (and all power effects)
have been finalized.

For example, a Solar will be able to add their Ability Ranks as a number
of Successes to their roll, turning what is a certain failure into a
success.

However, this does not come without a cost. The character is straining
themselves beyond their mortal bonds, and so will gain a point of
[Limit](/System/The System/#limit), a measure of how close their Great Curse is to
activating.

 Special Actions 
---------------

Most rolls are simple: the Player dictates what they are intending to
do, and the Storyteller tells them which (Attribute + Ability) to roll
and how much the difficulty will be.

However, there are a few specific situations that have special rules:

### Teamwork

Whenever a character uses their action to assist another, they may grant
a Moderate Advantage to another (+2 dice/+1 Difficulty) without the need
to roll.

If two people teamwork the same target, they may bump it up to a Major
Advantage (+4 dice/+2 Diff.), but no more than that is allowed.

### Contested Actions

Certain actions are contested between abilities of two or more
characters, rather than a simple difficulty.

In this case, all characters simply roll their appropriate Dice Pool,
and compare who got the highest number of Successes.

#### Taking the Average

To speed things along, the Storyteller is encouraged to take the
*average* number, rounded down, of the NPC’s dice pool. If they have 4-5
dice, simply state that they get got 2 successes and move on.

The exception to this guidance are important characters, such as rivals
or foes of great challenge.

######### There are two characters in the scene: a guard and a thief. The guard is keeping watch, and the thief is attempting to sneak past them. The dice pool for the player-controlled thief would be Dexterity + Stealth.

######### Since this is a NPC, and there are no dice-affecting powers active, the storyteller simply takes the average: (Wits + Awareness)/2, which turns out to be 3. Should the thief match or surpass that difficulty, they successfully sneak past.

### Group Rolls

If a *group* of people must all succeed on the *same* action—such as
sneaking—those character who exceed the difficulty may donate any extra
successes to their less fortunate group mates at a rate of *2 successes
given* per *1 successes received.* This is a special form of automatic
Teamwork.

So, if a group trying to succeed at a difficulty 3 check rolls 7, 3, and
1, the Player that rolled 7 would be able to give up their 4 extra
successes to give the last Player 2 successes.

###  Recall Fact

You have two options when determining Facts about the world:

1.  Ask the Storyteller a question.

<!-- -->

1.  Introduce a fact that your character “knows” about the world. This
    must not contradict the established setting in your game. (The
    Storyteller may veto a fact.)

Once you have stated your goal, the Storyteller determines the
difficulty of remembering that fact, which you roll against as normal.
If successful, the Storyteller must answer the question truthfully, or
note the introduced fact as part of reality.

Typically, this roll is (Intelligence + Lore), but it need not be. You
may use any Ability to know things related to that ability—such as using
*Archery* to recall facts of a famous archer. Lore simply is the Ability
that has no restrictions on use.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>The Non-Omniscient Scholar</strong></p>
<p>You are able to recall <em>facts</em>, not <em>truths</em>. “I want to know if Solars are actually Anathema” is not an appropriate use for Lore, but “Have Solars always been depicted as Anathema?” would be.</p>
<p>As well, facts known by a character are going to be <em>highly biased</em> depending on their backstory. As a Storyteller, don’t be afraid to give out advantages/disadvantages! A Dynastic monk will have <em>very different</em> sources of information than, say a Sidereal.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Read Intentions/Intimacy

Reading Intentions is a **Reflexive** Action.

When a character desires to understand another, they may attempt to read
the Intentions based on their actions, though this must be in *response*
to their target’s actions—you can’t simply read intentions of a
character who is doing nothing!

On a successful roll against a difficulty set by the Storyteller, as
dictated by the target’s social grace, the Player may ask a question to
the Storyteller about the target and the *character’s action*, ranging
from: “Who are they,” “What are they here (in the scene) for?” “Where
are they going?” “Do they intend me harm?”

The Storyteller is obligated to respond *truthfully* to the chosen
question, though it may be cryptic.

All Players may attempt the roll, but only the highest-roll gets to ask
the question.

###  Influence Intimacy

You may grant or *suppress* Intimacies in targets. Intimacy changes made
this way are temporary. They last at least a Scene, but will fade away
afterwards at the Storyteller’s discretion.

#### Emotion

Instead of a particular Intimacy, the character may choose to suppress
or inflame an *emotion*. This may have unpredictable effects. This may
be useful when targeting a disparate crowd, or if specific intimacies
are not known.

Emotions are always treated as a Moderate Modifier, and so only gain
+/-1 Resolve, compared to a full Intimacy.

### Perform Task

The character attempts to get another to perform a task on their behalf.

**Note:** Serious and Life-Changing Tasks will often require a full
Scene to occur before the roll may be performed—you can’t simply walk in
and change a person’s life! The rolls provided are for use for minor
characters and unimportant scenes. For more dramatic scenes, see
[Encounters](/System/The System/#encounters). (If the final roll involves a “Perform Task”
ask, the resolve bonus is not applied—the act of performing the
encounter wears down the Resolve over the course of the scene.

-   **Inconvenient task**  
    There is at most mild danger, opposition, or time devoted to this
    task. At most the task will take a few hours—maybe a day.

-   **Serious Task  
    ***(+2 Resolve) Must Leverage an Emotion or Intimacy to attempt.*

    There may be lasting repercussions to performing the task, ranging
    from physical to social. The task may take days to weeks to
    complete.

-   **Life-Changing** **Task  
    ***(+4 Resolve) Must leverage an Intimacy to attempt.*

    Their lives may be permanently altered by the task, running even the
    risk of death. Even embarking on the task will have serious
    consequences.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Players on the Defensive</p>
<p>The Player Characters are the main characters of the story, not NPCs.</p>
<p>When on the defensive from Social Actions, the Player still controls how the character acts in response to the roll, not the Storyteller. This is especially relevant for the “Perform Task” Action—the Player is free to interpret how and when they perform this task—they may be convinced that they need to help another character, but it will not override their free-will to do so.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**<span class="smallcaps">Social Interactions</span>**
------------------------------------------------------

Social actions are dependent on how they are approached. Using an
inappropriate action for a desired outcome will not work (no roll
required) or at least have severe penalties applied.

For example, no matter how well you roll, you cannot threaten someone
into gaining a positive intimacy towards you.

### Intimacies

All characters have various ideals, desires, and loved ones. An Intimacy
is a representation of their core being, who the person is—for better or
for worse.

An *Intimacy* is a step above a person’s natural likes and dislikes: it
is some aspect that defines them in some way.

Intimacies should be specific and close to your character’s definition
and goals:

-   “Hatred of the Realm’s Slavery Trade”

-   “Trust that inner enlightenment will bring about external good”

Intimacies are both a boon and a bane to characters—they have a
resistance to any social influence that runs contrary to that Intimacy.
However, those same Intimacies may be used to pull the character into
increasingly difficult tasks.

Whenever a character is confronted with something that *tugs* at their
intimacy—such as a convincing argument that the proposed action will
help them protect their family, they take a (-2) Resolve. However, if it
runs *counter* to their Intimacy, such as their deep-held believe to not
harm others, they gain (+2) Resolve.

Multiple Intimacies can be in play at the same time.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Assumed Intimacies</strong></p>
<p>There are common intimacies to all mortal kinds that don’t need to be explicitly written down, such as the Desire for Safety and Health, and the Fear of Death.</p>
<p>The list of Intimacies written for a character should only be written down if they are notable in their strength—or in the absence.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Temporary Intimacies

Minor, or *temporary* Intimacies are those present for just a short
time, often in response to something that has occurred in the
scene—ranging from something as large as great threat to the city
appearing, or from something more subtle as Social Influence to incite
an emotion.

Minor Intimacies are transitory—and not quite as strong as deeply held
beliefs, conferring (+/-1 Resolve). However, their effects can still be
quite strong on a large scale, and have resulted in societal upheaval
and market panics.

### Unacceptable Influence

There are certain actions and requests that a character will refuse to
do, regardless of how convincing, persuasive, or manipulative an Exalt
is, they will not do it. Unacceptable Influence protects those actions
that the character considered antithetical to their very nature, such as
betraying loyal causes, violating self preservation, or harming those
dearly loved.

Players, as they know their characters much better than the Storyteller,
reserve the sole right to declare if Influence is *Unacceptable*—though
they should justify it to the rest of the group.

### Changing Intimacies

At the completion of every **Story,** both the Players and the
Storyteller should reevaluate their respective characters and readjust
Intimacies as appropriate to reflect what has happened in the Story.

They may gain, or lose Intimacies as they see fit, though they should
have at least three and at most five.

### Group Resolve

Social actions against groups of people, rather than individuals, suffer
from the lack of intimacy, as well as logistics. Any social action taken
against multiple characters with a magnitude of “Crowd” (50 people) or
larger gains +2 to their Resolve.

Crowds of magnitude “City” or larger cannot be addressed by a simple
roll, and instead must be done through an Encounter.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Respect Your Group</strong></p>
<p>Throughout history people have committed horrific acts against each other—acts which still continue to this day. You may desire to show it as a proper challenge to overcome, to the levels that a character will sink to—even so called heroes. That said:</p>
<p><strong>No Person should ever feel uncomfortable at the table.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the day, this is a game that you and your friends are playing in modern times. Showcasing horrors of the past and the casual atrocities people have done to each other is a decision <em>you</em> are making right now.</p>
<p>Any Player (including the Storyteller) should be allowed to raise their concerns about scenes, direction of story, or other such aspects of the game, and their concern should be respected without question. Move the theme aside and don’t bring it up again.</p>
<p>A good tool to <em>minimize</em> these concerns is to have a “Session 0”, where all Players discuss what themes they expect out of a game, and what to avoid. However, this should not be seen as a substitute for listening to your Players at the moment. Often, they will not know what bothered them until it comes up.</p></td>
</tr>

</table>

 Essence
-------

Essence is the fundamental energy that flows through the world, all
creatures, and mortals—an energy that Exalts are naturally able to wield
to their advantage.

A character’s ability to manipulate and channel the energies of the
world are measured in **Motes** of **Essence**, a pool of points that is
immediately spent for supernatural effects, and slowly regains over
time.

Motes of Essence regain 1 per Hour when the character is taking explicit
action to rest, such as sleeping, playing games, or participating in
(relatively) stress-free activities that they enjoy.

The entire Mote Pool regains after a full night’s of rest, regardless of
how large the pool is. However, a character will **lose** all their
accumulated Anima while resting.

The mote pool will increase with the character’s **Essence**, which is a
measure of how in tune the character is with the flows of energy through
and surrounding them. This Rating will increase automatically as the
character accrues xp.

### Anima

Exalts are not limited to just their own personal Mote Pool as a source
of their powers. The drive of action and movement will spur them to
greater and greater heights. This movement of power is represented as
*Anima*, a type of Essence Flow that is ultimately more fleeting, but
brimming with possibilities.

You gain Anima through a few means: On a **Critical Roll**, through
**Stunting** an action, or through taking a dedicated action to **Build
Power.**

</tbody>
</table>

#### 

####  Build Power

During heated moments, such as in Combat or Encounters, the Exalt takes
a moment to stoke their internal flames, drawing essence from the world
around them.

The Player describes how the Character focuses themselves, and rolls the
appropriate (Attribute + Ability), gaining a point of Anima for ever 2
successes rolled. (The Critical Roll Anima bonus does *not* apply on
this roll.)

Descriptions of Build Power can truly be anything. A Dawn Solar may find
solace in flourishing their weapon in a display of (Dexterity + Melee).
Another may find refuge in their thoughts, looking across others in
recollection with a (Int + Lore) roll.

Building Power encompass a number of thematic actions-- “Preparing for a
devastating blow” or “catching a breather” or “bringing all the clues
together in the mind.” It is intended to narratively reflect be the calm
before a very, very explosive storm of power and action.

As Building Power is a narrative device to represent a character pushing
above and beyond normal strength, trying to purposefully sit and gather
Power in scenes without any narrative weight behind it is not allowed.

#### Narrative scope

Since Anima fades away so quickly, Anima need not be tracked during
slower, more narrative portions of the game. Instead, use of Anima can
be allowed through taking extra time on their actions: roughly **5
minutes per Anima** expended.

#### Using Anima

Anima is used to empower the Exalts Anima Powers, as well as any
high-level Charms, Spells, or other sources of power that might call for
Anima in its activation cost.

Additionally, Anima may be used to empower a character’s
[**Strife**](/System/The System/#strife), a way for the Player to wrest control over the
narrative in their favor.

Lastly, there are a couple of raw uses of anima:

-   Expending 1 Anima to add 2 Dice to an action. This may only be done
    once per turn—you cannot expend 2 anima to get 4 dice.

-   Anima may be used in place of Motes, at a rate of 1 Anima per Mote.
    An unlimited amount of Anima may be expended this way.

    -   This is usually reserved for when all Motes have been expended,
        as Anima is typically a more precious resource.

### Anima Banner

As an Exalt gathers energy, their souls become suffused with crackling
energy, inflaming it into the seen world in a glorious expression.

Ultimately the Anima Banner is an *Aesthetic* matter—one used for Stunts
and descriptions.

When using their powers, the Exalted is bathed in their power, the
crackling energies surrounding them and forming into a unique expression
of their soul—the more power used. First, they crackle with subtle
energies across their skin. Then, this energy leaps across outwards,
forming an entire colored aura around themselves. Finally, they erupt in
their glorious fire, their body suffused in energy and their personal
symbols visible to all around them.

The Exalt may choose to consciously hide it, if in situations where
flaring their banner would be untoward. Hiding the anima banner requires
*dedicated* concentration.

Strife
------

The world of Creation will push even the mighty Exalted to the brink,
and in those moments of desperation, forcing them to delve into reserves
they did not know they had—and can rarely replicate when needed. This
moment is called a **Strife**.

Strife is a powerful tool for Player Characters to change the world
around them.

By spending **3 Anima** and performing a Stunt, the Player may:

-   Use a Lesser Power they have not purchased, but would otherwise
    qualify for. If they select a Permanent Power or one with an
    extended duration, it only lasts a Day at most.

-   Reset a Limited-Use Power they have, such as anything that must
    activated “Once per Story”. This can be done regardless of the level
    of the Power, and affects Anima Powers. They must still pay the
    original activation cost of the charm, in addition to the cost of
    the Strife.

-   Have an impact on the world through narrative means. The Player
    should feel free to dictate how they use their powers in a
    custom-tailored way for the situation, though this does require
    Storyteller approval to make sure it doesn’t *directly* solve the
    problem of the scene.

### Strife Guidelines

When using a Strife, the action should simply happen without a roll. So
long as a character *should* be able to do something, and it is *cool*
for them to do so, it *does.* In this way, it can be thought of as a
more powerful Stunt.

There are a few guiding restrictions to keep in mind with Strifes, which
should

-   Other character’s actions cannot be dictated: only those under
    control of the Player’s.

-   The Action cannot *directly* solve the scene; it can only assist and
    guide it.

-   The Action should flow naturally from the character—a Solar cannot
    suddenly shapeshift, for example.

**Example**

######### The Archer turns from the Dragonblood threatening her and focusing her essence into a point on their arrow. With a sharp hiss of air, she lets it loose into the nearest mountain, watching as the arrow explodes in an impressive show of Anima. The mountain rumbles as the snow dislodges, causing the newly-fallen snow to groan, rumble, and then start cascading into a deadly avalanche which rushes into the passage, sealing it and cutting off the dynasts reinforcements.

“I’m going to use my archery to cause an avalanche”. it changes the
environment, stopping any reinforcements—removing the time limit on the
challenge, but not destroying their enemy. It assists the Player and
their scene greatly, but does not solve it.

The Great Curse
---------------

Exaltation is a great and wondrous blessing from the Gods, but with it
comes a great and terrible Curse. Perhaps, as the ancient and lost
stories speak, the slain Enemies of the Gods lay this Curse upon their
servants as a last, spiteful word in their dying breath. Or perhaps it
is simply inalienable nature of man, exemplified and given root in
power.

Regardless of its source, every Exalt carries with them the Great Curse,
an aggrandized character flaw that can interrupt and sabotage a
character’s well meaning in spite of their better nature.

Each individual Exaltation book details their Great Curse, but it is
important to know that these are all *suggestions*. So long as a
character has a flaw that affects their decision, it is an acceptable
Great Curse.

Custom descriptions should always include three aspects: what the flaw
exposes in the character, what triggers the flaw, and what the character
will (most likely) do when they enter a Limit Break.

-   **Solars** suffer from their own Ego. They are those that tirelessly
    seek greatness and perfection, and may find others or even
    themselves not up to the standards they desire.

-   **Lunars** suffer from being trapped between worlds and are
    conflicted by the unknown. Are they man or beast? A part of society
    or apart from it? Their form is constantly shifting, so who are they
    really?

-   **Abyssals** have a portion of their self consumed by the void:
    something that is lost and that can never be reclaimed. It may be
    their name and relations; their lost vitality; a loss of emotion and
    feeling.

</tr>

### Limit

The stress and wear of an Exalt’s life will build and press upon them,
eventually driving them to a breaking point. This is represented by
Limit Points.

A Character gains **1 Limit** by:

-   Activating their Excellency

-   Encountering the limit trigger they have detailed as part of the
    Great Curse.

-   Working against one of their Intimacies, whether by choice or by
    force.

Limit Points represent how strained the Exalt is—how much wear and tear
their psyche and soul is under. The character starts at 0, not being
stressed, and can raise up to 10, a level of duress which they cannot
stand anymore, at which point they will be forced Limit Break.

#### Breaking Early

When a character is particularly stressed, such as by being defeated,
having their goals turned against them, their Intimacies being credibly
threatened, or any other event the Player deems “anguishing,” they may
see if the character Limit Breaks early.

**Roll a 1d10.** If the result is equal to or higher than their current
Limit, the character keeps it together. While they might be perturbed,
hurt, otherwise emotionally compromised, they retain full faculty of
their mind and actions. However, if they roll under their limit, they
prematurely snap.

The Player, knowing their character better than any at the table, may
forgo the roll altogether and simply decide their character snaps.
Remember, this should highlight the character’s flaws, and how it can
impact and impede the character’s own goals!

### Limit Break

When a character **Limit Breaks,** they lose all perspective on anything
that does not align with their **Great Curse** and will make active and
considered effort to fulfill it, regardless of the consequences.

A character Limit Breaking does not lose their faculties, nor do they
forget their Intimacies—but those are simply *secondary* to their Great
Curse. Often they will use convoluted and strange reasoning to justify
their actions.

A Limit Break lasts for an entire scene. Only performing a grave offense
against their own deeply-held Intimacies would be enough to snap the
character out of their actions prematurely.

At the end of a Limit Break, reset Limit to 0.

During a Limit Break, the character does not gain any limit—even from
activating their Excellencies. This effectively grants them **free use
of the Excellency for the entire scene**, though it will still raise
their anima level.

<p>There will be occasions when a character enters Limit Break, but turning it into a Limit Break Scene just doesn’t fit—it occurred during an otherwise lighthearted scene, or when the Exalt is in the middle of nowhere on their own, or the scene was just wrapping up.</p>
<p>If this occurs, with both the Storyteller and Player in agreement, the Character can postpone the Limit Break to a more appropriate scene—just don’t wait <em>too</em> long.</p></td>

Storyteller Timelines
---------------------

Rather than count the exact minutes and hours of effects, Exalted relies
on a more cinematic sense of time.

-   **Round**  
    Enough time for all characters present in the scene to perform at
    least one set of Actions.

-   **Scene**  
    Long enough to set out and accomplish a single, dedicated task.
    Combat from start to finish would be a scene, as would characters
    searching for clues in an old abandoned monastery. This typically
    spans minutes to hours.

-   **Session**  
    A single sitting of when Players begin and end roleplaying, spanning
    an entire night.

-   **Story**  
    Several sessions that form a full narrative arch: from establishing
    a threat to reaching the resolution.

-   **Chronicle**  
    A complete game, encompassing all the stories relevant to a set of
    characters.

 Magnitudes
----------

*Exalted* is styled in more of a cinematic, broad-sweeping style game
rather than a precise simulation war-game. Instead of detailing out
every person, time frame, or area, it will instead deal with measures of
*magnitude.*

Some Powers will declare an increase (or decrease) in a *magnitude*.
Those magnitude definitions are as follows:

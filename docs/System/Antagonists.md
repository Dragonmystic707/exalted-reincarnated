Antagonists
===========

Lesser Foes and Groups
----------------------

Lesser Foes are those that have no chance at harming their antagonists,
and instead will use their actions to **Support** a Greater Foe. During
their action, they may instead give ½ their Attack Pool in Impulse to
their Ally.

Lesser Foes may be **Grouped** together. For each increase in
**Magnitude**, they gain 5 Endurance and 2 to their Attack Pool.

**Mortals** Have a lesser pool of Endurance:  
10 + (Stamina + Athletics + Physique)

Fogsharks are creatures that live between the Spirit and Waking world,
and may only be found where the veil between the worlds is thin,
particularly in respect to the element of Water.

They swarm in the skies, dragging their fog and mists with them--a
fogshark attack can not occur in any bright-lit or otherwise illuminated
area.

**Tactics**

Fogsharks are ambush predators, almost always moving in small groups or
packs. Typically there will be a Prime shark to act as a Major Foe,
swarmed with a pack of Lesser Foes.

The sharks will ambush characters in seeming moments of physical
weakness, particularly any who is bleeding. They will perform a grapple
maneuver, and then single-mindedly attack their target until forced off.

If forced off their target, or by missing their grapple, they will
attempt to retreat to the mists to await their next attack.

Being mindless beasts, they *cannot be reasoned with*.

**Abilities**

**Blood in the Water  
**The Fogshark gains +3 on any roll to percieve or track characters that
are bleeding.

**The Fog  
**The Fog is a supernatural impairment to all senses, providing Full
Cover to those that cannot perceive through it. Characters must have
supernatural senses to attempt to pierce the fog, rolling against a
Difficulty 4 to counter only Partial Cover.

Fogsharks may sense through the fog without penalty.

**Dissolve into the Fog**  
As a Gathering Action, the Fogshark may return to the supernatural mist.
They may only do so once every three actions, and cannot reemerge from
the Fogs for at least one action after entering them.

Antagonists
===========

Lesser Foes and Groups
----------------------

Lesser Foes are those that have no chance at harming their antagonists,
and instead will use their actions to **Support** a Greater Foe. During
their action, they may instead give ½ their Attack Pool in Impulse to
their Ally.

Lesser Foes may be **Grouped** together. For each increase in
**Magnitude**, they gain 5 Endurance and 2 to their Attack Pool.

**Mortals** Have a lesser pool of Endurance:  
10 + (Stamina + Athletics + Physique)

Estimating Defenses
-------------------

When choosing or modifing enemies, you need to pay close attention to
the Defenses to make sure the combat is fun and interesting—*too high of
DV will result in an unfun combat,* because the Players will never be
able to hit their target.

Adjusting Endurance, rather than DV, is often the more reliable way to
show that an enemy is either tougher or weaker than their fellows.

It helps to judge what each DV number represents, and to keep in mind
that DV is an **average** of (Att + Abi), so an additional point in DV
is quite a large deal!

&lt;&lt;TODO: clean up the following draft&gt;&gt;

As a Storyteller, you job in combat is to make an interesting and
dynamic fight—even if the fight doesn’t have pre-generated characters.

The variety of mortals, monsters, and Gods you can throw at your Players
is endless, and their sources of the following Powers can be flavored
however you wish.

Typically, what you want to do is have a leadup for a Power—some action
that signals that the character will use it. Only the most powerful of
foes will offhand be able to use these powers, and not at the Greater
Level.

### Fogshark

**Endurance** 15  
**DV** 4  
Evasion 4  
Soak 3  
Attack Pool 8  
Base Damage 4

**Sensing**: 6  
**Stealth:** 8

Fogsharks are creatures that live between the Spirit and Waking world,
and may only be found where the veil between the worlds is thin,
particularly in respect to the element of Water.

They swarm in the skies, dragging their fog and mists with them--a
fogshark attack can not occur in any bright-lit or otherwise illuminated
area.

**Tactics**

Fogsharks are ambush predators, almost always moving in small groups or
packs. Typically there will be a Prime shark to act as a Major Foe,
swarmed with a pack of Lesser Foes.

The sharks will ambush characters in seeming moments of physical
weakness, particularly any who is bleeding. They will perform a grapple
maneuver, and then single-mindedly attack their target until forced off.

If forced off their target, or by missing their grapple, they will
attempt to retreat to the mists to await their next attack.

Being mindless beasts, they *cannot be reasoned with*.

**Abilities**

**Blood in the Water  
**The Fogshark gains +3 on any roll to percieve or track characters that
are bleeding.

**The Fog  
**The Fog is a supernatural impairment to all senses, providing Full
Cover to those that cannot perceive through it. Characters must have
supernatural senses to attempt to pierce the fog, rolling against a
Difficulty 4 to counter only Partial Cover.

Fogsharks may sense through the fog without penalty.

**Dissolve into the Fog**  
As a Gathering Action, the Fogshark may return to the supernatural mist.
They may only do so once every three actions, and cannot reemerge from
the Fogs for at least one action after entering them.

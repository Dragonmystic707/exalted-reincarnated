Creating an Encounter
---------------------

From the intricate dance of ballroom politics, to battlefield war bands,
to the high-drama of a courtroom, an Exalt’s life will be filled with
scenes of great importance where the fate of the world hinges on
well-spoken speeches or careful deliberation.

In such moments, one or more Scenes should be dedicated to it. This
Encounter system is a *framework* intended to help Storytellers craft
dramatic scenes.

An Encounter, at its fundamental, boils down to two overarching
questions: “**What You \[PCs\] Want”** and “**What They \[NPC’s\]
Want.**” Each group works to further their goals, while trying to
prevent the other from advancing their own goal.

### The Doom Counter (What They Want)

As a Storyteller, you are to write down **What They Want**, and decide
how difficult it is for the NPCs to get to their target—how many
distinct actions they will have to take in order to reach their goal if
unimpeded. This is the **Doom Counter—**if it is filled,

If each action is **certain,** where an antagonist need only *take* the
action to fill the doom counter, the number of actions should be:

|                            |            |          |                 |
|----------------------------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Doom Counter (Certain)** |            |          |                 |
| **Easy**                   | **Medium** | **Hard** | **Challenging** |
| 3                          | 5          | 7        | 9               |

Certain Actions can represent a myriad of things—the simplest being the
passage of time, an oppresive clock ticking down to harm to Player’s
actions. But it can be any range of things, from a city guard pursuing
them, an approaching avalanch burying the battlefield.

If each action is **conditional,** or are not certain to succeed when
the antagonist takes their action the number of actions should be:

|                                |            |          |                 |
|--------------------------------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Doom Counter (Conditional)** |            |          |                 |
| **Easy**                       | **Medium** | **Hard** | **Challenging** |
| 2                              | 3          | 5        | 7               |

**Conditional** actions come in two flavors: they are advanced when an
antagonists takes an action that requires a roll, and succeeds on said
roll (such as attempting to sway, influence or otherwise inconvenience a
Player character.). Or, they can be **reactively advanced** to whenever
a Player Character does something—typically failing on a roll.

The Players should be made aware of this doom counter, even if their
characters are not—it will only heighten the tension in the scene. This
can be done simply by having a number ticking down on the screen, some
figure being filled in, or physical counters being slowly taken away.

Of course, the *nature* of the Doom Counter should be rarely
known—simply a ticking clock towards doom is enough.

There can be **multiple** Goals for NPCs in the scene, completely
independent of each other---but it is suggested to never have more than
**3**, as that becomes too much to track.

As well, if a scene is relaxed and easygoing, there is a possibility
that there is **no** Doom Counter—the risk here is not an external force
that imposes complications, but the Player Characters making a mess of
the Scene themselves.

#### Pushing Doom Back

Player Characters can *counter* the doom counter by taking considered
actions to **halt** or **reverse** the doom counter.

You, as the Storyteller, will have to decide if the Player’s described
action will either prevent the doom counter from advancing this round,
or remove a point from the counter—the former being much easier than the
latter.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Abstract Antagonists</strong></p>
<p>It is easy to recognize an antagonist when it is an individual. However, Antagonists can be anything—mobs of people, the environment, or even Time itself.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Complications

Each time a **Doom Counter** is filled, a complication is introduced
into the Scene, ready to trip up, halt, or just alter the course of the
Player Characters.

The simplest Complication is the most absolute: the Antagonist gets what
they want, the Scene ends, the Player Characters lose. Typically this is
only associated with at least Hard Dooms, and is a result of the Players
completely ignoring the impending doom.

The other complications, those far more likely to happen, will simply
*change* the scene in a way that is detrimental to the Player
Characters. As time goes on and more Dooms are fulfilled, the Scene will
become more and more untenable, to the point where the Players may have
to bail on their goals.

**Examples:**

-   The City Guard shows up, requiring the Player Characters to sneak
    around, or else risk an unwanted confrontation.

-   Half of the Scene gets buried under snow, unable to interacted with.

-   Characters needed for questioning scatter. The Players must actively
    search for them.

### Key Issues (What You Want)

When the Encounter starts, a certain **Goal** must be clearly decided by
the Players—if there is no clear Goal, take a moment to discuss it. The
goal does not need to be overly complex: “Escape” is quite a popular
one, after all.

Once the Goal has been established, think up **1-3 Key Issues** that are
preventing the Goal from being accomplished. Again, these need not be
overly complex-- a simple sentence is all that is needed for a Key
Issue. If you cannot think of any at the spot, is is perfectly fine to
use the Goal itself as the singular Key Issue.

Each Key Issue should have a Counter, much like the Doom Counter. Each
**successful action** that Players take will fill in a piece of the
Counter, and if there is a **Critical Success** (8+), it either fills in
two counters, or fills in one counter and prevents a **Doom Counter**
from being filled.

As this is a narrative section, you, as the Storyteller, must decided if
a stated action would fill in the counter or not—but you must
communicate this to your Players before they undertake their action.

Not all actions will lead to filling in the Key Issue—there are plenty
of actions that are either in support, or lead up to a deciding action.

|---------------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Key Issue** |            |          |                 |
| **Easy**      | **Medium** | **Hard** | **Challenging** |
| 3             | 5          | 7        | 9               |

<td><p>Large Groups</p>
<p>If you have more than 4 Players, you should increase the number of actions required for each Key Issue by +1 per Player.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Hidden Issues

Like the Doom Counter, the *presence* of a Key Issue and the number of
actions needed to perform it should not be kept secret—Players must know
they are making progress in a Scene, and know that it is heading toward
a resolution.

However, the *nature* of a Key Issue may not be known—especially in an
intrigue Scene, finding out what *blocks* the goal is nearly as
important as taking actions to counter it. There are two ways to handle
it:

The **first way** is to simply not state what the Key Issue is, and
periodically drop hints as to what it is. If they take actions that are
even tangentially related to countering the issue, they get to take a
reflexive action using the **Read Intentions** rules to uncover the
nature of the Key Issue.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Accidental Progress</p>
<p>Most of the time, a Hidden Key Issue will require uncovering what the Issue is before proceeding. Only the most targeted actions are supposed to advance the Counter.</p>
<p>However, either through educated guesses or sheer good luck, a Player might take an action that <em>precisely</em> matches a Key Issue. In this case...let the issue be filled, and give them a large hint as to what the Key Issue is.</p>
<p>This should be the <em>exception</em>, though. If their action is tangentially or near to the Key Issue, simply let them uncover the nature.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The **Second Way** is to have another Key Issue whose goal is to
**Uncover** the nature of the Key Issue. What you are doing here is
essentially *splitting* the Key Issue in two—half of its actions are
dedicated to uncovering the nature, the other half to countering it.

#### Consequences

In an Encounter, it is important that Player Actions have
*Consequences—*these are **Complications** that arise directly because
of the Player’s Actions.

The classic example is that of intimidation: if a Player Character gets
what they want through terrorizing people into townsfolk, they should
*get what they want*, but it will carry with it a price. The townsfolk
will find themselves hostile, cowed, or scared of the Players, and be
less friendly and forthcoming with information.

Essentially, an Encounter should never remain *static*, and should
change and update with every character’s action. Think of it like a
shifting scene with branching paths—sometimes some actions will close
doors and possibilities, while others will open them up. Make sure your
Encounter is *dynamic*.

However, care should be taken with Consequences: they should never feel
like a *punishment*. Your job is to keep your Players on their toes, not
to discourage them from taking unique and interesting ways to solve a
problem. This is a situation where a little bit goes a long way: only
introduce a mechanically-effecting consequence when it truly matters to
change the scene.

### Flow

An Encounter does not *need* to have a rigid timing system like
Combat—it is a narrative space where actions and reactions happen as
seems fitting.

The one rule is that all character should have a *chance* to act/react,
before a character acts again.

Once the Players have fulfilled their Key Issues (or the Antagonist has
fulfilled theirs), the Encounter scene ends—there is no need to stick
around for anything but the optional **final argument**, which wraps up
the scene and moves forward.

### Specific Rules

#### Altering/Adding Goals

During the Encounter, the Players may decide they want to alter the
ultimate goal—perhaps they have decided to push further, or have found
an alternate goal they prefer.

In both cases, the Storyteller should add an additional Key Issue to
encapsulate this difference. They may decide to drop a separate existing
Key Issue if the altered goal no longer applies.

#### Final Argument

Optionally, the Encounter is wrapped up with a *Final Argument*, where a
chosen Player or Storyteller summarizes what has happened in the
Encounter, rolling it together and pointedly delivering as a capstone.
This can take the form of a grand in character speech, addressing the
crowds.

The roll—if there is one—for this moment carries no risk of sabotaging
existing progress, rather it is a push for *something more*.

#### Environmental Ailments

The Exalted are *resistant* to casual exposure disease, warping effects
from the Wyld, and other such external debilitation of the soul, but it
does not mean they are *immune* to such effects, to say nothing of their
mortal followers.

Traversing past the threshold of the Wyld, the catacombs of the
Underworld, or in the middle of a plague should *feel dangerous* and
risky—if they choose to do such a thing, then they are inviting
disaster.

Any of these effects should be treated as an Antagonistic Key Issue—at
least of Average complexity against an individual Exalt. (Simple against
a mortal).

The Storyteller can advance this Key Issue either as an *active* action
of the Environment, or as a reflexive effect that happens when the
Characters take a specific action.

If successful, the character should gain a dot or two of a deleterious
“merit” that must take a Project to remove.

#### Characters on the Defense

Convincing important characters, particularly Player Characters, is a
single Key Issue with a base complexity of Average (3), or Difficult (5)
if they have an opposing Intimacy to the idea.

This can be anything from forcing the character to see their point on an
important fact, charming them, lying to them, or even instilling a
particular Intimacy.

A successful application does not *force* the character to do
anything—this isn’t unnatural influence, simply convincing speech. But
they should take this new idea as part of their decision process. As
well, after the idea impacts their life negatively once, they may
reconsider and reject it.

As always, Players reserve the right to declare something as
Unacceptable influence, if they believe it violates their character or
ideas—but they must **Cheat Death** in order to avoid the influence.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>It’s Hard to Convince Player Characters</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately, it’s up to the Player whether or not their character is convinced by something. As a Storyteller, you have control over all aspects of the world, and how difficult each action is; the one thing that you don’t have control over is what Player Characters think and do—you should only suggest it to the Player, not force it upon them. Even powerful effects, such as “Theft of Memory,” should be used with caution.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this is a story about the <em>Player Characters</em> and their actions, not about Non-Playable characters and your world!</p>
<p>Social-focused Antagonists should be primarily represented by their actions and charm against other NPC’s. While they should not shy away from trying to charm the Player Characters, don’t expect them to succeed!</p></td>

Encounter Types
---------------

### The Journey

The Player Characters are on a journey from one point of the map to the
other. Their Goal is to simply get there as fast and safely as possible.

Unless the terrain is *actively hostile*, such as the treacherous deep
sea or the ever-shifting Wyld, the **Doom Counter** is only filled when
the Player **roll poorly—**but there may be a creature or force actively
hunting them as well.

**Complications**:

-   Getting Lost

-   Losing supplies

-   Coming upon dangers.

-   Leaving a traceable trail.

**Key Issues**

-   Unknown Path

-   Dwindling rations

-   Hostile environment, such as frigid temperatures.

Example Encounters
------------------

### Example 1: The Trade Prince

On the southern shores of the Inland Sea party decides that they will
need a full caravan to traverse the Burning Sands. There is a local
Trade-Prince whom they think they can convince to finance and supply
them this caravan.

#### Goal

Convince the Trade-Prince to fund their expedition.

#### Key Issues

The Storyteller decides there are 3 Key Issues preventing the
Trade-Prince from funding the caravan:

1.  **Monetary concerns  
    *(Simple—1)***

    Understandably, the Trade-Prince will need to be convinced it is
    worth his while to dedicate so many resources to this goal.

<!-- -->

1.  **Antagonistic Sycophants  
    (*Average—3*)**

    The Trade-Prince has surrounded himself with sycophants, who deeply
    despise any perceived change to their position. The Party must
    silence their influence.

2.  **Fear of the Immaculate Order Retribution  
    (*Difficult—5*)** ***(Hidden)***

    Through the party’s past actions, the Trade-Prince has secretly
    caught on that they are Anathema. He does not personally care, but
    he will need a way to make sure that the Immaculate Order will not
    find out about this deal—or at least be convinced of this fact.

#### Complications

Hidden Key Issue. The Storyteller will not immediately indicate that the
Immaculate Order has a presence in the scene, only dropping hints along
the way to signal that its influence is here.

###  Example 2: Escape

They were on a simple *reconnaissance* mission: infiltrate the Guild’s
meeting, and discover their end goal. They didn’t realize that a Slave
Trader was part of the meeting, nor that their Zenith caste would have
such a violent reaction upon discovering this fact.

Now, they need to escape before the entire city is called down upon
them.

#### Goal

Escape from the Guild Hall.

#### Key Issues

1.  **Physically Escape (silently)  
    (*Average—3)***

    They will need to traverse the complicated and guarded corridors of
    the guild hall.

<!-- -->

1.  **Remove Presence  
    *(Difficult—5) (optional)***

    If they are to get their plans back on track, they will need to
    confuse people who saw them into misremembering what happened, and
    remove any indications that they were here tonight.

2.  **Calm Rampaging Ally  
    *(Difficult—5)***

    Their Zenith cast ally is currently limit breaking, seeking to
    destroy the slaver’s guild and free all of the ‘merchandise’ with
    their sheer force of will. They need to be either appeased or forced
    to take their mission in a better way.

#### Complications

This is a timed scene, with actual defined, structured rounds. The
Storyteller has decided that on Round 3, the guards will alert the guild
hall.

On Round 5, more guards and innocent bystanders will fill the hall,
increasing the difficulty of all stealth rolls.

On Round 7, the gates will be closed, presumably forcing a failure of
the scene.

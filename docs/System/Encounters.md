Creating an Encounter
---------------------

From the intricate dance of ballroom politics, to battlefield war bands,
to the high-drama of a courtroom, an Exalt’s life will be filled with
scenes of great importance where the fate of the world hinges on
well-spoken speeches or careful deliberation.

In such moments, one or more Scenes should be dedicated to it. This
Encounter system is a *framework* intended to help Storytellers craft
dramatic scenes, and thus should be treated as guidelines rather than
firm rules.

### Goal

You have to first decide what the Goal of the scene *is*. What is it the
Players ultimately want? Sometimes it may be obvious from the context,
but many other times you may need to ask them what their ultimate goal
is. This is the first hurdle in starting an Encounter.

It is fine if the goal *changes* during the course of the Encounter,
there just needs to be something there to start with..

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Simple Goals</p>
<p>It’s perfectly fine to have simple, assumed goals. Not everything needs to have a complex or structured goal; sometimes a primal need is all a goal has to be. “Survive” is quite a popular one.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Key Issues

Once a goal has been established, identify and breakdown what stops the
Players from reaching their goals. (2-3 are suggested, and never more
than 5). Each of these obstacles are **Key Issues** that need to be
overcome before the goal can be reached.

Key Issues can truly be anything—personal or political entanglements,
terrain difficulties, or even logistics issues. So long as it fits the
theme of the scene, and is a solid, self-contained idea, it can be a Key
Issue.

Once the Key Issues have been identified, decide how many successful,
distinct, *actions* must be made to overcome the Key Issue. This is an
abstracted representation not of difficulty (that is determined by
individual rolls), but of *complexity*.

Visualizing progress is important in an encounter—and it is recommended
you keep your players in the loop that they are working towards their
Key Issue! Having a set of tokens to remove, or something as simple as
check-boxes to fill does wonders!

|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Key Issue Complexity** |             |
|                          | **Actions** |
| Simple                   | 1           |
| Average                  | 3           |

| Complex                  | 7           |

### Generating Key Issues

It can help to visualize distinct challenges relating to the key issue,
such as: “Number of people to convince over to my side,” or “stages of
stealth to overcome.” However, always remember that you are setting up a
*challenge* for players to overcome, not the method for which they must
go through, and this abstracted count of actions should allow that
flexibility!

It is entirely possible for you to expect your players to talk to
individual bystanders, to inspire each one of them to raise moral of the
village, yet your Players instead craft a monument of glory—and that is
perfectly fine and encouraged! So long as each action has a narrative
weight, even if unexpected, it should be allowed!

###  Complications

Complications are anything introduced into the Scene by the Storyteller
that will distract, inhibit, or otherwise challenge the Player
Characters in their pursuit of their goals.

Complications can change, alter, or otherwise shed different light on
the Key Issues, and may even block certain methods of attaining their
goals. Perhaps a landslide occurs, burying the way to a quarter of the
city; or there is a patrol of guards cycling through the way; or even
perhaps something a simple as the chiming of the bells, denoting that a
new hour has arrived.

Complications should show up fairly regularly—there should be at least
one per Encounter. However, they should always make sense and be
telegraphed to players beforehand. If the source of a Complication is a
character, say a primary antagonist or a group of guards, this is quite
easy—players will expect them to take an action every “Round” or so.

However, when it is something more abstract, such as the passage of
time, you should signify it with something, be it the description of a
clock’s hand ticking down, or the more abstract notion of displaying a
counter filled up after actions performed. Suspense in a scene is not
necessarily surprise: if you give your Players just enough information
that there is *something* going to happen, when their Characters do not,
it is far more satisfying and impactful when it actually does.

 Playing an Encounter
--------------------

### Flow

An Encounter is not like a Combat Scene—the timing is fluid, and actions
do not follow a set order, depending primarily on the natural flow of
the narrative.

By default, the concept of “Round” is not necessary in an Encounter—only
in the manner that each character gets one action per “Round”--i.e. a
character cannot simply chain actions together without others getting a
chance to act.

However, if an encounter is *timed*, you may use Turn Order method as
detailed in Combat.

### Consequences

Consequences are essentially **Complications** that arise in the story
because of *Player Choices*.

The classic example is that of intimidation: if a Player Character gets
what they want through terrorizing people into townsfolk, they should
*get what they want*, but it will carry with it a price. The townsfolk
will find themselves hostile, cowed, or scared of the Players, and be
less friendly and forthcoming with information.

Essentially, an Encounter should never remain *static*, and should
change and update with every character’s action. Think of it like a
shifting scene with branching paths—sometimes some actions will close
doors and possibilities, while others will open them up. Make sure your
Encounter is *dynamic*.

However, care should be taken with Consequences: they should never feel
like a *punishment*. Your job is to keep your Players on their toes, not
to discourage them from taking unique and interesting ways to solve a
problem. This is a situation where a little bit goes a long way: only
introduce a mechanically-effecting consequence when it truly matters to
change the scene.

### Altering/Adding Goals

During the Encounter, the Players may decide they want to alter the
ultimate goal—perhaps they have decided to push further, or have found
an alternate goal they prefer.

In both cases, the Storyteller should add an additional Key Issue to
encapsulate this difference. They may decide to drop a separate existing
Key Issue if the altered goal no longer applies.

### Antagonist Goals

Antagonists are operating on their own goal during the scene, and have
their own Key Issues that they must Gather Influence upon.

Typically, the Antagonist’s Goal and Goals and Key Issues are directly
related to the Party’s—whether in direct opposition, or competing to get
there first. For convenience sake, these are referred to as the “the
same” Key Issue.

However, antagonists having the same Key Issue is not a
*requirement*—they may be working on a separate Goal for the scene, and
they have tangential or completely unrelated Key Issues. Typically,
these start out as hidden to the Party.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Abstract Antagonists</strong></p>
<p>It is easy to recognize an antagonist when it is an individual. However, Antagonists can be anything—from mobs of people to an avalanche to <em>Time itself</em> closing off a Key Issue.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Sabotaging Progress

The Antagonist and Party’s Progress tracks are independent of each
other, and can be thought of more as a “race” rather than anything.
However, just like in a race, participants can *sabotage* the other’s
progress.

When taking an action, a Player can apply one of their actions to
removing the progress of an antagonist by one action. Or, they may
attempt to wrest control over a completed Key Issue piece by piece—the
latter of which often requires one action greater than

Control may be taken away if a different side gains more Influence than
the previous owner, either by decreasing it through sabotage or
reinforcing their own claim.

In order to wrest control over a completed Key Issue, you must take 1
*additional* action more than what would be normally required. So for an
Average (3) complexity issue, you would have to make a total of (4)
actions.

### Characters on the Defense

Convincing important characters, particularly Player Characters, is a
single Key Issue with a complexity equal to their Resolve + intimacy
bonuses, rather than a simple roll.

This can be anything from forcing the character to see their point on an
important fact, charming them, lying to them, or even instilling a
particular Intimacy.

A successful application does not *force* the character to do
anything—this isn’t unnatural influence, simply convincing speech. But
they should take this new idea as part of their decision process. As
well, after the idea impacts their life negatively once, they may
reconsider and reject it.

As always, Players reserve the right to declare something as
Unacceptable influence, if they believe it violates their character or
ideas. Typically they should reference one of their Intimacies,
backstory, or Facts when doing so.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>It’s Hard to Convince Player Characters</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately, it’s up to the Player whether or not their character is convinced by something. As a Storyteller, you have control over all aspects of the world, and how difficult each action is; the one thing that you don’t have control over is what Player Characters think and do—you should only suggest it to the Player, not force it upon them. Even powerful effects, such as “Theft of Memory,” should be used with caution.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this is a story about the <em>Player Characters</em> and their actions, not about Non-Playable characters and your world!</p>
<p>Social-focused Antagonists should be primarily represented by their actions and charm against other NPC’s. While they should not shy away from trying to charm the Player Characters, don’t expect them to succeed!</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Encounter End

The Encounter ends the same Round that all Key Issues become
*controlled*—though they do not need to be under control all by the same
*side.*

If a Goal’s Key Issues are completely controlled by one side, they will
achieve their Goal.

A Goal with split Key Issue control will find they have a *partial*
victory—they do not get the full Goal they wanted, but they do not get
nothing at all.

When weighing a Partial Victory, the Storyteller should lean heavily
into the uncontrolled Key Issues—why will this bring trouble to them?
Perhaps they get what they want, but only at a certain cost?

### Final Argument

Typically, the Encounter is wrapped up with a *Final Argument*, where a
chosen Player or Storyteller summarizes what has happened in the
Encounter, rolling it together and pointedly delivering as a capstone.
This can take the form of a grand in character speech, addressing the
crowds.

Preferably, Encounters do not end with a roll. The work has been put in
already, there is no *need* for one.

But in the cases when a roll feels In those cases, this final roll
carries no risk of failure with it: after all, all of the ground work
has been laid for the outcome already. Rather, it is a measure of *how*
successful the characters will be in their endeavor. A failure would
just represent not being able to push their success further—or at worst,
a request to do something in return.

Example Encounters
------------------

### Example 1: The Trade Prince

On the southern shores of the Inland Sea party decides that they will
need a full caravan to traverse the Burning Sands. There is a local
Trade-Prince whom they think they can convince to finance and supply
them this caravan.

#### Goal

Convince the Trade-Prince to fund their expedition.

#### Key Issues

The Storyteller decides there are 3 Key Issues preventing the
Trade-Prince from funding the caravan:

1.  **Monetary concerns  
    *(Simple—1)***

    Understandably, the Trade-Prince will need to be convinced it is
    worth his while to dedicate so many resources to this goal.

<!-- -->

1.  **Antagonistic Sycophants  
    (*Average—3*)**

    The Trade-Prince has surrounded himself with sycophants, who deeply
    despise any perceived change to their position. The Party must
    silence their influence.

2.  **Fear of the Immaculate Order Retribution  
    (*Difficult—5*)** ***(Hidden)***

    Through the party’s past actions, the Trade-Prince has secretly
    caught on that they are Anathema. He does not personally care, but
    he will need a way to make sure that the Immaculate Order will not
    find out about this deal—or at least be convinced of this fact.

#### Complications

Hidden Key Issue. The Storyteller will not immediately indicate that the
Immaculate Order has a presence in the scene, only dropping hints along
the way to signal that its influence is here.

###  Example 2: Escape

They were on a simple *reconnaissance* mission: infiltrate the Guild’s
meeting, and discover their end goal. They didn’t realize that a Slave
Trader was part of the meeting, nor that their Zenith caste would have
such a violent reaction upon discovering this fact.

Now, they need to escape before the entire city is called down upon
them.

#### Goal

Escape from the Guild Hall.

#### Key Issues

1.  **Physically Escape (silently)  
    (*Average—3)***

    They will need to traverse the complicated and guarded corridors of
    the guild hall.

<!-- -->

1.  **Remove Presence  
    *(Difficult—5) (optional)***

    If they are to get their plans back on track, they will need to
    confuse people who saw them into misremembering what happened, and
    remove any indications that they were here tonight.

2.  **Calm Rampaging Ally  
    *(Difficult—5)***

    Their Zenith cast ally is currently limit breaking, seeking to
    destroy the slaver’s guild and free all of the ‘merchandise’ with
    their sheer force of will. They need to be either appeased or forced
    to take their mission in a better way.

#### Complications

This is a timed scene, with actual defined, structured rounds. The
Storyteller has decided that on Round 3, the guards will alert the guild
hall.

On Round 5, more guards and innocent bystanders will fill the hall,
increasing the difficulty of all stealth rolls.

On Round 7, the gates will be closed, presumably forcing a failure of
the scene.

Merits
======

A Merit is any sort of benefit or background that may help the
character, outside of their normal internal powers would grant.

Merits are often intimately tied to a character’s story—they have wealth
because they were born into it—and typically may only be gained or
upgraded during character creation, or through the Projects system
during campaign.

Almost all Merits are location or context-dependent, and so are often
restricted based on the nature of the story campaign.

When you purchase Contacts, for example, you must specify what their
nature is, and their location. i.e. “The assassins of the Eastern
Forests.”

Multiple merits of different locations and types can be purchased.

### Using Merits

Most of the time a Merit is just a statement of fact about your
character, and should simply shape the story with its
presence--Followers will do what you say, wealth backs a bribe attempt
with truth, and an ally will generally be helpful if they can be. A good
rule of thumb is that if the difficulty of the action is less than the
rating of the merit, it simply just happens.

On the rare cases when the outcome is uncertain, an appropriate
\[Attribute + (Ability or Merit rating)\] may be asked for. For example,
you may raise a glorious ancient artifact to prove your worth to a crowd
with \[Composure + Artifact rating\], attempt to convince an ally to do
a dangerous task for you with \[Charisma + Ally\], or know a piece of
obscure Lunar history with \[Intelligence + Fact: Silver Pact Member\]

#### Exhausting Merits

At the storyteller's discretion, a Merit can be exhausted for a period
of time after a large, impactful use of the merit, and be unable to be
used except in limited ways. For example, after a character with Wealth
(4) manages to bribe the Prince of a city into their pocket, the
Storyteller declares that this is a serious use of their Wealth merit,
and that all significant expenditure of their wealth is now tied up into
this one action and must recover.

The Storyteller designates the length of time the merit is exhausted,
though this cannot last longer than a single story.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Merit Protection</strong></p>
<p>Merits cannot be removed or canceled <em>permanently</em> by the Storyteller without the Player’s permission, and should be considered under the complete ownership of the Player. For example, an Ally should not suddenly turn face and become an antagonist without both the Player agreeing to such a turn of events.</p>
<p>Temporary restrictions to merits—such as an Ally being unable to help in this situation, even if the merit isn’t exhausted—is explicitly allowed. However, the Storyteller should always be judicious about such decisions.</p>
<p>If a Player chooses to lose or downgrade their bought Merits through story means, they are awarded back whatever resources they used to buy or upgrade the Merit.</p>
<p>The Storyteller may decide to award temporary Merits that are under the full control and whim of the Storyteller—such as a platoon of soldiers as a Command. If appropriate to the story, the Player may purchase control of said Merit at full cost of either xp or Project Points, with Storyteller permission.</p></td>

### 

&lt;&lt;TODO&gt;&gt;

**Author’s Note:** Most existing merits in 3e work pretty well with
minimal translation to Exalted Reincarnated, so translating them over
properly has been a bit lower on my todo list. For the moment, 3e’s
merits will be a good placeholder.

Couple addendum to that:

-   Mutations are overpriced, knock them down a dot or two.

-   Ambidextrous, Martial Artist, and Hideous don’t do anything.

-   Hearthstones should just be considered an Artifact, without any need
    for a Manse.

&lt;&lt;/TODO&gt;&gt;

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Merit Count</strong></p>
<p>There is no enforced limit on the number of a Merits a character can have. However, this shouldn’t be used as an excuse to hoard a laundry-list of low-rank merits.</p>
<p>The rule of thumb is that you should start consolidating merits at 10, and should not have any more than 15 individual merits. (Excluding Facts and Languages)</p></td>

### 

General Merits
--------------

### Facts

**(3)**

Facts are simple, undeniable statements about the character that may
help them in their adventures. They are the most free-form of all the
merits, and encompass anything from a description of a character’s
origin to markers of accomplishments.

Facts are typically chosen during character creation, awarded at the end
of a Story, or to mark completion of a significant world Project.

Natural Merits
--------------

### Backing

**(1-5)**

The Character is an official in an organization. Their rating represents
how much organizational power the character has.

For example, Backing 2 would either represent being the head of a local
organization, or the leader of a local chapter of a global organization.

The Character may instruct subordinates to Perform a Task without
question, so long as it is in line with the goals and morals of the
organization.

*Disadvantage:* Higher-ranking members may call upon the Character to do
a task and uphold duties. As well, lower members may come to the
Character for guidance.

### Bond(1-5)

**Special Note**: Bonded individuals must each have the Bond merit,
though the level does not need to be the same.

Your soul has been entwined with another, uniting your Destinies. The
character instinctively knows if their Bond is in danger, and the
general direction they are in.

Influence to directly harm, endanger, or otherwise disadvantage their
Bond is treated as Unacceptable Influence. This may be used reflexively.

*Disadvantage:* Their Bonded may always use the Bond in place of an
Intimacy to socially influence the character.

### Contacts (1-5)

You have a network of contacts in a given location and class of society
willing to give you information.

Every story, you may *Introduce a Fact* with information gathered by
your Contacts without expending a Strife Point for every point of
Contacts.. The Fact must be centered on information your Contacts could
have gathered.

### Cult(1-5)

The Character is a leader and/or target of worship for a religious cult,
gaining **+2 Peripheral Motes** per dot Rating.

*Disadvantage:* The cult requires periodic guidance and attention. As
well, it is often an unwelcome influence and potential political hazard.

### Wealth (1-5)

Wealth is a renewable source of money. A character with any source of
Wealth needs not worry for basic necessities or sustenance, and may
always purchase a place to rest.

Targets can be paid (or bribed) to Perform a Task without needing a roll
or any Social Influence. Some characters may refuse this offer, or even
be offended by it.

&lt;&lt;TODO: Translate over more of the Resources merit&gt;&gt;

### Ally (1-5)

Allies are individuals, groups, or organizations that a character may
call upon to aid them in their endeavors—proven to be an asset.

Allies are not at the whim and mercy of the character—they have their
own lives and concerns to deal with, but they can be assumed to not
willingly or knowingly hurt the player character.

The Rating of Allies represents both the scale and influence of the
ally: Rating 1 would be a competent, but still mortal--guard. Rating 3
would be an Exalt or a medium spanning organization. Rating 5 would be a
high-rating God or an organization such as the Guild.

### Artifact (2-5)

Artifacts are items that contain wondrous, supernatural effects upon the
world. Artifacts typically have some sort of inherent supernatural
usefulness to them that is **immediately available** on purchase of the
artifact.

Evocations are Powers the artifact contains that must be awakened by
**additionally** purchasing Evocations with xp.

Rating 2 Artifacts are minor wonders: they have some sort of inherent
supernatural usefulness, such as a water skin inlaid with jade that
filters and purifies all water within. Rating 2 Artifacts have **no**
Evocations.

Rating 3 Artifacts have up to 3 Evocations.

Rating 4 Artifacts have up to 5 Evocations, and have a Greater
Evocation.

Rating 5 Artifacts have up to 5 Evocations, and have 2 Greater
Evocations.

### Language (1)

Each purchase of this merit represents a new language the Player
Character has learned to speak, read, and write in.

**Note**: All Characters start with 2 Languages, typically their Local
Tongue, and the trade Language Riverspeak.

**Example Languages**

-   **Local Tongue:** This marks the character as having the exact
    speech patterns and mannerisms as locals.

-   **Directional Language**: While not a true language in itself, a
    Directional Language is a collection of general speech patterns and
    dialects that would fit as “close enough” with the local tongue of
    anybody living in the respective Cardinal Directions (Air, Water,
    Fire, Wood) to communicate most thing.

-   **High Realm**: While using the same words and structure as Low
    Realm, formal and rigorous selection of certain words have marked
    the language of the Elite of the Realm into its own recognizable
    pattern.

-   **Low Realm:** Used by the commoners of the realm, this is a blend
    of Tradespeak and High Realm. The words and written characters are
    blended and simplified.

-   **Old Realm**: An ancient language which High Realm is based off of,
    though no longer shares all but the base similarities. Is the formal
    text of Ancient texts and documents from the First Age, and is still
    the most commonly-used mortal language used by the Gods.

-   **Riverspeak:** An artificial, crafted language made by the Guild to
    facilitate basic trade, and heavily promoted as the common language
    of Creation. While functional, it does not lend itself well to
    communicating complex topics.

### Master Stylist (3)

**Mortal-Only**

Allows a mortal to purchase Techniques of a specific Style, (excluding
Greater Techniques), and grants them a mote pool of 10 that may only be
used on the styles Techniques.

A Mortal may learn this merit on their own, though it is rare.

Supernatural Merits
-------------------

Most Supernatural Merits require *Storyteller Approval* to purchase.

### Endowment (3-5)

Gain access to a Supernatural Ability normally outside your purview.
This must be given as a boon from a supernatural entity that already has
access to that Supernatural Ability.

Mortal Sorcerers must have this merit to access Sorcery or Necromancy.

Endowment grants access to a mote pool of 10 if the character does not
have one. This mote pool may only be used for this specific Endowment.

If a Mortal Exalts with this merit, and that supernatural ability is
granted to them, they are refunded the merit costs.

-   **3—**Use of the Ability, but restricted to a specialty. For
    example, Shapeshifting into only one creature.

-   **4—**Use of the Ability, restricted to a specialty, with the
    ability to purchase related Charms (excluding Greater Charms).

-   **5—**Use of the Ability in its entirety and the ability to purchase
    its Charms, (excluding Greater Charms).

At Essence 3, Exalts may take a Project to grant Rank 3 to mortals with
significant ties to them, such as Allies or Wards.

Banes
-----

-   **(-1, -2) Environmental restriction:** The character cannot live
    outside a specific, non-standard environment. -2 means this is
    temporary, such as amphibians drying out on land, -4 will cause the
    character to start dying.

-   **(-1)** **Reflexive action**: (Cannot be paired with Subtle). The
    Mutation will react to stimuli, without any control of the
    character. (Chameleon skin changing color when under stress, for
    example)

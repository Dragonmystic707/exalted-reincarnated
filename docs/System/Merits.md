Merits
======

A Merit is any sort of benefit or background that may help the
character, outside of their normal internal powers would grant.

Merits are often intimately tied to a character’s story--they have
wealth because they were born into it--and typically may only be gained
or upgraded during character creation, or through the Projects system
during campaign.

Merits bought with XP or with Project Points cannot be removed or
cancelled *permanently* by the Storyteller without the Player’s
permission, and should be considered under the complete ownership of the
Player. For example, an Ally should not suddenly turn face and become an
antagonist without both the Player agreeing to such a turn of events.

Temporary restrictions to merits--such as an Ally being unable to
help--is explicitly allowed. However, the Storyteller should always be
judicious about such decisions.

If a Player chooses to lose or downgrade their bought Merits through
story means, they are awarded back whatever resources they used to buy
or upgrade the Merit.

The Storyteller may decide to award temporary Merits that are under the
full control and whim of the Storyteller--such as a platoon of soldiers
as a Command. If appropriate to the story, the Player may purchase
control of said Merit at full cost of either xp or Project Points, with
Storyteller permission.

\[\[ TODO**: Most merits are location-specific, or restrained in some
way.** Your cult is in X location, your language is Y language. I need
to denote this. \]\]

Merits with Charges
-------------------

In addition to their base effect, Merits in this category have
**Charges** equal to their Dot Rating.

### Backing(1-5)

The Character is an official in an organization. Their rating represents
how much organizational power the character has.

For example, Backing 2 would either represent being the head of a local
organization, or the leader of a local chapter of a global organization.

*Disadvantage:* Higher-ranking members may call upon the Character to do
a task and uphold duties. As well, lower members may come to the
Character for guidance.

**Additional Use*:*** The Character may instruct subordinates to Perform
a Task without question, so long as it is in line with the goals and
morals of the organization.

### Bond(1-5)

Your soul has been entwined with another’s, uniting your Destinies. The
character instinctively knows if their Bond is in danger, and the
general direction they are in.

**Note**: Bonded individuals must each have the Bond merit, though the
level does not need to be the same.

*Disadvantage:* Their Bond may always use the Bond in place of an
Intimacy for Social Influence.

**Additional Use:** Influence to directly harm, endanger, or otherwise
disadvantage their Bond is treated as Unacceptable Influence. This may
be used reflexively.

### Contacts (1-5)

You have a network of contacts in a given location and class of society
willing to give you information.

**Additional Use:** You may *Introduce a Fact* with a charge of
Contacts, rather than a Strife Point. The Fact must be centered on
information your Contacts could have gathered, in place of a Speciality.

### Cult(1-5)

The Character is a leader and/or target of worship for a religious cult,
gaining **+2 Peripheral Motes** per dot Rating.

*Disadvantage:* The cult requires periodic guidance and attention. As
well, it is often an unwelcome influence and potential political hazard.

### Wealth (1-5)

Wealth is a renewable source of money. A character with any source of
Wealth needs not worry for basic necessities or sustenance, and may
always purchase a place to rest.

*Disadvantage:* If the extent of your Wealth is known, people may
request charges of your Wealth.

**Additional Use**: Targets can be paid (or bribed) to Perform a Task
without needing a roll or any Social Influence. Some characters may
refuse this offer, or even be offended by it.

Standalone Merits
-----------------

### Ally (1-5)

Allies are individuals, groups, or organizations that a character may
call upon to aid them in their endeavors--proven to be an asset.

Allies are not at the whim and mercy of the character--they have their
own lives and concerns to deal with, but they can be assumed to not
willingly or knowingly hurt the player character.

The Rating of Allies represents both the scale and influence of the
ally: Rating 1 would be a competent, but still mortal--guard. Rating 3
would be an Exalt or a medium spanning organization. Rating 5 would be a
high-ratinging God or an organization such as the Guild.

### Artifact (2-5)

Artifacts are items that contain wondrous, supernatural effects upon the
world. Artifacts typically have some sort of inherent supernatural
usefulness to them that is **immediately available** on purchase of the
artifact.

Evocations are Powers the artifact contains that must be awakened by
**additionally** purchasing Evocations with xp.

Rating 2 Artifacts are minor wonders: they have some sort of inherent
supernatural usefulness, such as a water skin inlaid with jade that
filters and purifies all water within. Rating 2 Artifacts have **no**
Evocations.

Rating 3 Artifacts have 2-4 Evocations, with the maximum Essence
requirement being Essence 3

Rating 4 Artifacts have 3-6 Evocations, with the maximum Essence
requirement being Essence 4

Rating 5 Artifacts have 5-10 Evocations with the maximum Essence
requirement being Essence 5

### Language (1)

Each purchase of this merit represents a new language the Player
Character has learned. All characters are assumed to start with their
Local Tongue and Tradespeak, the common language.

**Example Languages**

-   **High Realm**: While using the same words and structure as Low
    Realm, formal and rigorous selection of certain words have marked
    the language of the Elite of the Realm into its own recognizable
    pattern.

-   **Low Realm:** Used by the commoners of the realm, this is a blend
    of Tradespeak and High Realm. The words and written characters are
    blended and simplified.

-   **Old Realm**: An ancient language which High Realm is based off of,
    which is the formal language of ancient texts. Most Gods still use
    Old Realm to communicate with Mortals, and have not bothered to
    learn the new languages.

-   **Directional Language**: While not a true language in itself, a
    Directional Language is a collection of general speech patterns and
    dialects that would fit as “close enough” with anybody living in the
    respective Cardinal Directions (Air, Water, Fire, Wood). This

-   **Local Tongue**: This marks the character as having the exact
    speech patterns and mannerisms as locals.

### Manse (3-5)

\[\[You get a manse!\]\]

Banes
-----

    outside a specific, non-standard environment. -2 means this is
    temporary, such as amphibians drying out on land, -4 will cause the
    character to start dying.

-   **(-1)** **Reflexive action**: (Cannot be paired with Subtle). The
    Mutation will react to stimuli, without any control of the
    character. (Chameleon skin changing color when under stress, for
    example)

Supernatural Ability(N/A)
-------------------------

\[\[Grants the ability to purchase a specific Supernatural Ability (such
as Sorcery). Typically used for mortals. It’s how you do Thaumaturgist.

You have to convince a God (or other creature of power) to give you this
ability. It’s not something you can do in a Project---hence (N/A)

Exalted characters cannot start with this Merit. \]\]

Mutation (X)
------------

\[\[Might have a bit of a different thing for mutations than just pure
points. Something like “You build the effect the mutation gives you. +1
DV is 2. Obvious -1.

That or I spell out specific mutations. 3e Core has them priced way too
high though.

Low priority.\]\]

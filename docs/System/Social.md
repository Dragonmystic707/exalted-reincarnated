Social Influence
================

Intimacies
----------

All characters have various ideals, desires, and loved ones. An Intimacy
is a representation of their core being, who the person is—for better or
for worse.

An *Intimacy* is a step above a person’s natural likes and dislikes—it
is some aspect that defines them in some way.

Intimacies should be specific and close to your character’s definition
and goals:

-   “Hatred of the Realm’s Slavery Trade”

-   “Trust that inner enlightenment will bring about external good”

Intimacies are both a boon and a bane to characters—they have a
resistance to any social influence that runs contrary to that Intimacy
(+2 Resolve).

However, those same Intimacies may be used to pull the character into
increasingly difficult tasks. (+2 Dice).

<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Assumed Intimacies</strong></p>
<p>There are common intimacies to all mortal kinds that don’t need to be explicitly written down, such as the Desire for Safety and Health, and the Fear of Death.</p>
<p>The list of Intimacies written for a character should only be written down if they are notable in their strength.</p></td>

### Unacceptable Influence

There are certain actions and requests that a character will refuse to
do, regardless of how convincing, persuasive, or manipulative an Exalt
is, **they will not do it.**

Unacceptable Influence protects those actions that the character
considered antithetical to their very nature, such as betraying loyal
causes, violating self preservation, or harming those dearly loved.

Players, as they know their characters much better than the Storyteller,
reserve the sole right to declare if Influence is *Unacceptable*—though
they should justify it to the rest of the group.

### Defining Intimacy

Some characters have an Intimacy so central to their character, that it
is considered their **Defining Intimacy**.

Characters cannot be made to work *against* their Defining Intimacy—it
is Unacceptable Influence.

However, they are much more susceptible to its influence. Any valid
attempt to leverage the **Defining Intimacy** will have a bonus to do
their task. (+4 Dice)

A character may have only **1** Defining Intimacy. Most characters do
not have a Defining Intimacy at all.

### Changing Intimacies

At the completion of every **Story,** both the Players and the
Storyteller should reevaluate their respective characters and readjust
Intimacies as appropriate to reflect what has happened in the Story.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Respect Your Group</strong></p>
<p>Throughout history people have committed horrific acts against each other—acts which still continue to this day. You may desire to show it as a proper challenge to overcome, to the levels that a character will sink to—even so called heroes. That said:</p>
<p><strong>No Person should ever feel uncomfortable at the table.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the day, this is a game that you and your friends are playing in modern times, surrounded by modern schools of morality.</p>
<p>Any Player (including the Storyteller) should be allowed to raise their concerns about scenes, direction of story, or other such aspects of the game, and their concern should be respected without question. Move the theme aside and don’t bring it up again.</p>
<p>A good tool to <em>minimize</em> these concerns is to have a “Session 0”, where all Players discuss what themes they expect out of a game, and what to avoid. However, this should not be seen as a substitute for listening to your Players at the moment. Often, they will not know what bothered them until it comes up.</p></td>

Social Actions
--------------

Social actions are dependent on how they are approached. Using an
inappropriate action for a desired outcome will not work (no roll
required) or at least have severe penalties applied.

For example, no matter how well you roll, you cannot threaten someone
into gaining a positive intimacy towards you.

While the **Social Category** Attributes are the majority fit for Social
Actions, they are not exclusive.

For example, Intimidation may be done with (Strength + Physique), or
bamboozle with (Wits + Deception). Finding creative interpretations of
the character’s strengths is perfectly valid!

### Groups

Social actions against groups of people, rather than individuals, suffer
from the lack of intimacy, as well as logistics. Any social action taken
against multiple characters with a magnitude of “Crowd” (50 people) or
larger gains +2 to their Resolve and Guile.

Crowds of magnitude “City” or larger cannot be addressed by a simple
roll, and instead must be done through an Encounter.

### Perform Task

**(Roll) vs. Resolve**

The character attempts to get another to perform a task, and are
categorized into three tiers:

-   **Inconvenient task**  
    There is at most mild danger, opposition, or time devoted to this
    task. At most the task will take a few hours—maybe a day.

-   **Serious Task** **  
    **(+1 Resolve)  
    Must leverage an Intimacy to attempt.  
      
    There may be lasting repercussions to performing the task, ranging
    from physical to social. The task may take days to weeks to
    complete.

-   **Life-Changing** **Task** **  
    **(+2 Resolve)  
    Must leverage a Defining Intimacy to attempt.  
      
    Their lives may be permanently altered by the task, running even the
    risk of death. Even embarking on the task will have serious
    consequences.

### Influence Intimacy

**(Roll) vs. Resolve**

The character leverages an *existing* Intimacy to either suppress a
different Intimacy, install a New Intimacy, or raise an existing
Intimacy into a Defining Intimacy.

Intimacy changes made this way are temporary, eventually fading away
after a day without reinforcement.

This action cannot decrease a permanent **Defining** **Intimacy**.

#### Emotion

Instead of a particular Intimacy, the character may choose to suppress
or inflame an *emotion*. This may have unpredictable effects. This may
be useful when targeting a disparate crowd, or if specific intimacies
are not known.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Players on the Defensive</p>
<p>The Player Characters are the main characters of the story, not NPCs.</p>
<p>When on the defensive from Social Actions, the Player still controls how the character acts in response to the roll, not the Storyteller. This is especially relevant for the “Perform Task” Action—the Player is free to interpret how and when they perform this task.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Read Intentions

**(Insight + Ability) vs. Guile** **  
**Reading Intentions is a **Reflexive** Action.

When a character desires to understand another, they may attempt to read
the Intentions based on their actions.

On a successful roll against the target’s Guile, the Player may ask a
question to the Storyteller about the target, ranging from: “Who are
they,” “What are they here (in the scene) for?” “Where are they going?”
“Do they intend me harm?”

For every extra +3 successes rolled, the Player may ask another
question.

The Storyteller is obligated to respond *truthfully* to the chosen
question, though it may be cryptic.

Only one Read Intentions maneuver (per target) may be made due to the
target’s actions. All Players may attempt the roll, but only the
highest-roll gets to ask the questions.

### Probe Intimacy

**(Roll) vs. Guile**

Intimacies, emotions, and other aspects of a character may be pressed by
the Player, forcing it to be revealed.

The Player, through their action, will state what behaviors they are
trying to induce or analyze with their action. If successful, the
Storyteller will need to tell them the closest relevant Intimacy there
is to the action --or the decided lack of one.

This may be used in an Encounter to probe for the nature of a Key Issue.

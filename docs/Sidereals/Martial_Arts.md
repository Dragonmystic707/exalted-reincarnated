Martial Arts
============

Heartstring Weaver Style
------------------------

Written by **Codex Empyrean**

**Abilities** Archery, Serenity  
**Weapons** Bow  
**Armor** Unarmored, Light

Accuracy is calculated off of (Archery + Serenity)

While in this style the practitioner is able to forge a simple ward for
themselves or an ally by solidifying the ambient love and compassion
around them.

The Practitioner bolster’s their allies, choosing (**Essence**) wards as
combat breaks out. The ward applies a temporary bonus to maximum
**Endurance** to the target equal to the practitioner’s **Essence x2**.
All damage will affect the ward first.

When the ward fades, either by loss of damage or if the Practitioner
decides to terminate it, the Practitioner may spend 2i as a Reflexive
action to whisk the target of the ward towards themselves, so long as
the ward is within Medium Range.

### The Heart Skips a Beat

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Primary (Maneuver)  
**Mins:** Archery 2, Serenity 1

The Archer of Joy rolls the entirety of an emotion into their shot,
imparting it into the target. Perform a Ranged Attack Maneuver with
(Dex. + Serenity). If it is higher than the **Resolve** of the
character, force them to discard 3 + (Essence) Impulse.

### Drunk on Love

**Cost**: 5m, 1i (+3m)  
**Type**: Supplemental (Decisive Attack)  
**Mins**: Archery3, Serenity 2

The Practitioner channels the ambrosia of distilled love into a single
arrow intoxicating the target. The archer makes a Decisive attack versus
the target’s Resolve, not DV. If the target takes at least 5 points of
damage, and the Archer pays an additional (3m), the target will randomly
attack any target on their next action.

### Heart-A-Flutter

**Cost**: 5m  
**Type**: Reflexive; Scene  
**Mins**: Sorcery 4, Serenity 3:

The Practitioner becomes buoyed and carried by the very emotions of
serenity, allowing them to jump 20 meters into the air, as well as
drifting down slowly, unable to take Falling Damage.

When taking a Move action, the practitioner may do so vertically, even
into thin air. However, if they end their action without firm footing,
their next Round’s Move Action will be consumed by them slowly drifting
to the ground.

### Wellspring of Compassion

**Cost**: 8m, 2i  
**Type**: Simple  
**Mins**: Archery 4, Serenity3

An Archer of Compassion can reweave their arrows to heal rather than
damage. Upon impact the arrow bursts into a shower of pink sparks. The
target’s wounds begin to seal and a wellspring of energy fills them.  
  
The target regains Endurance equal to the archer’s (Serenity + Essence).

### Duality of Love

**Cost**: 7m, 2i  
**Type**: Simple; Instant/One Scene  
**Mins**: Archery 5, Serenity 4

The Practitioner weaves into their arrow either the pain and sorrow of
love or its warmth and hope.

**Sorrow**  
When imbuing the arrow with sorrow they deliver a devastating blow to
the target’s psyche. The user makes an attack, using (Dexterity +
Serenity) as their roll, (Essence) as their Base Damage, and the
Target’s (Resolve) in place of DV. In addition to dealing Damage, the
target suffers paralyzing grief for (Essence) rounds, only able to take
either a Primary or Secondary Action during their turn.

**Love**  
You create a bonding tie between the target and a concept, person, or
ideal of your choice on an (Dexterity + Serenity) hit over their
Resolve. Any Lesser Foes becomes an ally of that binding, whereas
Greater Foes gain an intimacy towards it, and must roll their (Will +
Integrity) vs (Practitioner’s Serenity) to directly harm it for the
remainder of the scene. If they succeed once on their roll, the Intimacy
is dispelled.

 

Charcoal March of Spiders
-------------------------

**Abilities** Sorcery, Secrets  
**Weapons** Unarmed  
**Armor** Unarmored

While in this style, any movement action the practitioner takes is
crawling across the Loom itself, rather than the physical space. This
allows crawling through physical barriers, and avoiding environmental
effects.

The Practitioner is considered to be **Dematerialized** during these
brief moments, and cannot perceive the outside world.

The Practitioner reduces any grapple attempts made against them by -2
successes.

The Practitioner may use (Dexterity + Secrets) for their unarmed Attacks
Rolls.

### Unnatural Steps

**Cost:** 5m  
**Type:** Supplemental (Move); Scene  
**Mins:** Sorcery 2, Secrets 1

The Practitioner clings to the strands of Fate, not the ground beneath
her feet. The practitioner may redirect to where she falls towards—be it
towards a certain wall, a beam, a ceiling. This target must be part of
the scene and cannot be a person.

The Practitioner must use this technique again to change or cancel this
effect.

### Maw of Dripping Venom

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Supplemental (Decisive)  
**Mins:** Sorcery 3, Secrets 2

On an attack that deals at least 1 point of damage, the target
immediately loses either 5 Peripheral Motes or 2 Impulse (Practitioner’s
choice).

### Rain of Unseen Threads

**Cost:** 8m  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Sorcery 4, Secrets 3

The Practitioner shoots out up to (Essence) threads to unattuned,
unattended objects, or otherwise unclaimed scenery within Medium Range,
and tears at their reality, altering some metaphysical aspect of them.
Pillars become soft as clay, toppling over in an instant; water as light
as air and rising to the sky.

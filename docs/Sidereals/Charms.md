### Faultless Ceremony

**Cost:** 2m  
**Type:** Simple; Week  
**Mins:** Performance 2, Serenity 1

On completing a Project worth at least 10 PR, and that results in a
grandiose ceremony--anything from a newborn’s naming to a funeral--the
Celestial Bureaucracy smiles on those non-Exalted citizens who performed
in the ceremony, blessing the inhabitants. Crops grow larger, harmony
and peace is enjoyed, and so on for a month. Any attempts to disrupt
this Fate receives -1 success on their attempts.

### Perfection in Life

**Cost:** 5m  
**Type:** Simple; Day  
**Mins:** Performance 2, Serenity 2

The Sidereal performs in front of a group no larger than 100 people,
rolling a (Charisma + Performance) Action Roll, while leveraging a
particular Intimacy. Any audience member in concordance with that
Intimacy, and with a Resolve less than what was rolled gains +1 to their
Resolve for a Day.

### Defense of Shining Joy

**Cost:** 5m, 2i  
**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Mins:** Performance 3, Serenity 2

Assisting another with the glorious tempo, the Sidereal gifts
+(Performance)/2 to the target’s Evasion. The Sidereal may only grant
this to (Essence) targets, and may not give it to herself.

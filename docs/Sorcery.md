Sorcery and Necromancy
======================

Sorcery is the complex manipulation and control of the flows of Essence
of the world, rather than their internal flows. Instead of Charms,
Sorcery relies on ritualistic, exact recantations called Spells and
Thaumaturgies to enact the power upon the world.

Sorcery is split into **Three Circles**, the first being the lowest.
Each tradition and tutor will have a different name for the circle,
although the most widely known is **Emerald, Sapphire,** and
**Adamant**, respectively.

<p>It is known that Dragonblooded do not reach past the First Circle: that power is corruptive, created by the Anathema to tempt and trap those that seek power for the sake of power--save for the pure and righteous Empress herself.</p>
<p>So says the Immaculate philosophy.</p>
<p>But there is no such declaration. Careful Monks, when reviewing the passages so often quoted as proof, will find it lacking. Proper historical context and translations from Old Realm will unravel this as an “incorrect surface level reading.”</p>
<p>Perpetually, there will be a champion who takes on the mantle to correct this, to pull up this noxious weed that has grafted itself to the Immaculate Order. But so far, they have all been silenced.</p>
<p>For now, those very few who manage to reach the Second Circle do so in secret, hiding in dark corners of the Realm.</p></td>

Necromancy
----------

The art of Necromancy was stolen from the Void, and has become a part of
Sorcery--much to the ire and horror of many Sorcerous Practitioners.

Initiation into either Sorcery or Necromancy will qualify the user to
both.

The Rules of Necromancy are the same as Sorcery. For convenience, the
rules will simply state "Sorcerer" instead of "Sorcerer or Necromancer".

Casting Spells
--------------

Spells, unlike charms, pull their magic from the precise manipulation
and twisting of the laws of reality to the Sorcerer’s will. The
Sorcerer's expenditure of Motes is a way to speed up their Casting --a
Sorcerer without a mote pool would be required to take days or months to
prepare and cast even the First Circle of Spells--if at all.

In order to purchase Spells, a character must first be Initiated into
the respective circle.

<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Moteless Casting</strong></p>
<p>There are alternate ways to cast Spells, whether it be through purpose built Wonders, long, elaborate rituals, or even physically rearranging the Essence lines of Creation itself.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, none of these methods can or will be used by Player Characters--Sorcerous Motes are faster and easier in every way--but it can be an interesting narrative tool for a crafty Storyteller.</p></td>

</tbody>

Sorcerous Motes
---------------

Sorcerous Spells relies on the manipulation and alteration of the
world's energies around them, rather than the internal expression of
power that Charms are.

Shaping a spell is therefore represented by **Sorcerous Motes (sm),**
which represent the usage of external Essence to twist and conjure the
mechanics of the world into the shapes needed for the Spell.

**Sorcerous Motes** are pulled *exclusively* from the **Peripheral
Mote** Pool--meaning that using a spell will always agitate the Anima
Banner.

As well, shaping Sorcerous Motes is *not instantaneous*. There is a
distinct time of starting to Shape the Spell, to the ending and release
of the spell.

Lastly, Sorcerous Motes are *unique* to the Spell that is being
cast--you cannot swap which Spell is being cast midway through Shaping
the Motes.

### Non-Combat Casting

In all non-combat scenes (including Encounters), casting a spell takes
two Actions: one to Shape, and the next to release the Spell.

In essence, all characters get a full action to react to a spell being
cast.

### Combat Casting

Casting in the time-regimented Combat Scene is handled more granularly
by taking **Shape Motes** Action

#### Shape Motes

**Primary Action  
Impulse Cost**: 0

Roll (Intelligence + Sorcery). You may shape up to that number of
Peripheral Motes into the Spell's Sorcerous Motes.

The Anima Banner immediately flares according to how many Peripheral
Motes have been shaped in this action.

Once all Sorcerous Motes of the Spell have been gathered, the Spell
immediately takes effect, and the Anima Flare will jump to the total
cost of the Spell.

Countermagic
------------

Once a Spell has been cast, it is incredibly difficult to undo,
requiring a **Project.**

-   **First Circle** 2 RES

-   **Second Circle** 5 RES

-   **Third Circle** 10 RES

All Spells, once unravelled, have a chance of their discarded magics
being cast aside in wild effects. A single **Challenge Roll** should be
performed for the unravelling to see if a side-effect occurs.

Initiation
----------

While all Exalts *can* become Sorcerers, it does not come naturally to
them. They must first be **Initiated** into the mysteries of the world
by creatures of power, or life-changing events. Their link to power
becomes their guide through all three circles throughout their
life--swapping tutors is unheard of.

While it is almost always the case, the Master teaching and Initiating
their pupil does not need to be of the Circle the student is being
inducted into--they don’t even necessarily have to be a sorcerer
themselves.

The First Circle Sorcery can be learned at Essence 0. While extremely
rare, there are even known Mortals who have become Sorcerers.

The Second Circle Sorcery requires Essence 3, and the Third Circle of
Sorcery requires Essence 5, in almost all cases.

Each Circle Initiation grants a (N/A) Merit that allows the Sorcerer to
learn the respective Circle of Spells, along with another effect that
has been derived from their source of Power.

### **I**nitiation Tasks

The Laws of Sorcery written into the world dictate that each
**Initiation** must be accompanied by a **Task**. The Masters inducting
their students are required to have this minimum during an induction.
Often, the Master will concoct their own tests and preparations for the
**Task**, as failing the higher-circle Task may bring doom and
destruction on all.

The **First Circle Task** is fairly simple: the student must seek out
and be selected for Induction into Sorcery.

The **Second Circle Task** requires the student to be **Essence 3**, and
will result in them suffering the equivalent of a **Major Drawback**--a
repercussion that will be felt across multiple scenes, if not the
character’s entire life.

The **Third Circle Task** requires the student to be **Essence 5**, and
will result in a permanent change in the character.

<p>However, while Sorcery is a part of the workings of Creation, The Second and <em>especially</em> the Third Circle Spells are rather rough on the Loom of Fate. More often than not, these overt, flashy, and incredibly disruptive actions run counter to all of Sidereal methodology.</p>

Sources of Sorcery
------------------

\[\[Possible sources of Sorcery. Not exhaustive\]\]

### Pact with Ifrit Lord

One of the Lords of fire has granted you power, breathing a shard of
themselves into your body.

#### First Circle (Kindled)

While casting, the skin of the Sorcerer becomes glowing hot, burning
with their inner fire. Crackling rivulets trace along like flames across
their skin.

#### Second Circle (Ignited)

Fire comes naturally to the Ignited.

The Sorcerer gains a +1 defense against all natural Fire damage, and
finds little trouble breathing in smoke-filled rooms.

#### Third Circle (Firestorm)

\[...\]

### Chosen by the Salinian Working

The First Age Sorcerers feared that their knowledge and practices would
be lost to the ages, and so bound it into the fabric of reality so
tightly that it has become indistinguishable.

This process will select and teach those it chooses, according to those
arcane rules written so long ago and lost to time.

The Salinian Working will appear in a way that represents knowledge to
its potential Student: it may be a book that writes itself or the
whispering of the winds.

#### First Circle (Emerald)

#### Second Circle (Sapphire)

#### Third Circle (Adamant)

### Heptagram Study

The Heptagram trains Dragonbloods in the First Circle, and warns of the
Second and Third Circles. They often do not differentiate the
“Anathematic” levels.

Ancient, old texts untouched by generations since the Shogunate call
these Celestial and Solar Levels.

#### First Circle (Terrestrial)

#### Second Circle (Celestial \[Anathematic\])

#### Third Circle (Solar \[Anathematic\])

By additionally expending 3 *personal* motes, the Exalt may reduce the
anima flare caused by a casting by one level.

Spells
======

Summon Demon
------------

Summon Demon need only be purchased once as a spell, but may be used to
summon greater demons as the Sorcerer becomes initiated into higher
circles.

#### First Circle Summoning

**Cost:** 8sm; Ritual  
**Mins:** Sorcery 1

Summoning of the First Circle demons must be done with a demon’s name
class (such as “Blood Ape Pack”), and is a ritual lasting 1 hour, ending
at the moment of sundown.

A demon of the First Circle is summoned and bound to a particular task.
The Sorcerer must make a deal with the bound demon for this task,
suffering the equivalent of a **Minor** **Complication** as a way to
bargain with the Demon, otherwise it will return back to whence it came.

In return, the Sorcerer tasks the Demon with a change worth **2 RES** or
less, which they will do for at most one Month. Anything from “digging a
tunnel” to “Entertain guests.” However, summoning does not inherently
grant the demon the ability to *do* such things.

The Sorcerer cannot have more than (Essence)x2 active Summoned Demons
(or groups of demons) at a time.

Demons, once their agreement has been made, will follow both the spirit
and the letter of their binding. Additionally, they are bound to not
harm their Summoner. In other words, demons can be assumed to be loyal
to their summoner and are generally not interested in trying to
creatively break out of the bindings.

However, Demons should always be considered to be *alien* in mind, not
understanding much of how mortals and their summoner think. A Blood Ape
will not think twice about instantly choosing to murder someone instead
of politely shooing them away, were the Sorcerer to ask them to “prevent
people from disturbing me”.

#### Second Circle Summoning

**Cost:** 12sm; Ritual  
**Mins:** Sorcery 3

Once inducted into the Second Circle of Sorcery, the Sorcerer may summon
Second Circle Demons. This may only be done on the night of the New
Moon.

Second Circle Demons may make changes up to **5 RES** upon the world.

Second Circle Demons must be bargained with a task that will cause the
summoner to take a **Moderate Complication**. If failed or refused, the
Second Circle Demon often return peacefully from whence they came, but
the more belligerent may try to break their summoning bonds and even
attack the Sorcerer.

The Sorcerer may have only (Essence) Second Circle Demons (or pack of
demons) summoned at a time.

#### Third Circle Summoning

**Cost:** 15sm; Ritual  
**Mins:** Sorcery 5

Once inducted into the Third Circle of Sorcery, the greatest demons may
be summoned, though this may be done only on the first night of
Calibration, which comes once a year.

Third Circle Demons may make vast and wide-ranging changes to the world,
up to **15 RES** in scale.

Bargaining with a Third Circle Demon requires a **Major Complication**.
To fail or refuse is to let the demon free for the remaining four nights
of Calibration, a disaster in the making.

Only 1 Third Circle Demon can be summoned at a time.

First Circle
------------

### Coin of Distant Vision

**Cost:** 5sm  
**Mins:** Sorcery 1

When learning this Spell, the Sorcerer coalesces their flows of essence
around a shard of obsidian, entwining their senses with it, regardless
of its distance.

The Sorcerer may choose to peer their the obsidian shard as though it
were their own senses. If the shard is in a small container, such as a
pocket or pouch, they may sense beyond with a (-2) disadvantage.

The Sorcerer may remotely disentangle their sense from the obsidian
shard as a Secondary Action. This will require them to craft a new
connection to a new shard, which typically takes an evening to do. Only
one shard may be used at a time.

### Corrupted Words

**Cost:** 5sm; **Mins:** Sorcery 2  
**Duration:** One Year  
The Sorcerer coalesces a mass of all taboo words and topics into a small
egg-shaped mass in their hands, and whispers into it a new topic that
shall be bound with its unspoken peers. This could be something as
specific as “Secret Letters you will write to me” or as general as “The
Existence of the Sidereal Exalted.”  
On a successful (Intelligence + Sorcery) roll vs. Resolve a target, and
while close enough to physically do so, the Sorcerer may force this ball
of unspoken words down the throat of the target, binding their words on
the now taboo topic.

The now bound words will become impossible for the target to communicate
to another being--be it through words, written letters, or any other
such method. Attempting to do so will cause a vision of a mass of
writhing, repulsive maggots (or whatever else the target finds
repulsive) crawling from their mouth.

The Sorcerer may affect no more than (Essence) targets with this spell
at a time, and may choose to discontinue their charges at will.

### Theft of Memory

**Cost:** 5sm; **Mins:** Sorcery 2  
**Duration:** Indefinite

Focusing on a specific, known memory, the Sorcerer makes a (Cunning +
Sorcery) roll vs the Target’s Guile.

If successful, they place an pure-cut emerald (Resources 2) on the
forehead of their target, and siphon the memory away into the gem. The
target may no longer relive the memory. Anyone with the gem may spend
1m, clasp it to their forehead and relive it.

The Sorcerer, casting this spell again, may pull the memory out of the
emerald, where it will return back to its original owner.

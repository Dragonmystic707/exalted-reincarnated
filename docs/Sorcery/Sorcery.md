Sorcery is an extension of the **Occult** Ability. It is the
manipulation and control of the flows of Essence of the world, rather
than their internal flows. Instead of Charms, Sorcery relies on
ritualistic, exact recantations called Spells to enact the power upon
the world.

Spells are different than charms, as they are **exact, classified**, and
**known by name.** Charms are simply descriptions of things the Exalted
naturally gravitate towards—Spells are ritualistic, prescribed motions
that bring about the same result that must be learned. Only the most
skilled of Sorcerers can even make aesthetic changes to the spells they
perform.

The three levels of Spells are classified and known in the world of
Creation and have many names depending on the tradition and culture of
the sorcerer. The most widely known an accepted is **Emerald**,
**Sapphire**, and **Adamant** to represent Lesser, Greater, and
Capstone, respectively.

### Initiations

All Exalts have the *potential* to become a Sorcerer, but they still
need to be initiated into the arts by some sort of mentor. A Player
should be able to point to a specific Merit their character has as a
source of their training, such as an Ally, or one of their starting
Facts.

When advancing to the **Sapphire** and **Adamant** Circle Spells, their
mentor will require a **Task** to be performed. The mentor must ask the
Exalt to undertake something they find difficult in order to find a
deeper enlightenment and understanding of themselves before they are
allowed such power over the world.

Access to the **Sapphire Level** has a repercussion to the character for
years on end, changing how they view life and themselves. The **Adamant
Level** Task will have a permanent change to their character.

These tasks could be any such as sacrificing a cherished item, scaling a
cliff devoid of their exalted powers, or facing their greatest fear.

<td><p>Raksi and the Third Circle</p>
<p>By all accounts, the elder Lunar Raksi should be a Third Circle Sorcerer—she has all the training and ambition to do so.</p>
<p>However, she has stubbornly refused to complete her Task—the moment she saw what was required, she balked at and immediately vowed to find another way. Which is, of course, impossible.</p>
<p>However, if there was ever one who could break that impossibility, it would be Raksi, and should she ever find such a way, it would be a terrible day for the foundations of Creation as it is known.</p></td>

###  Sources of Sorcery

The simplest way to be taught sorcery would be to be mentored by an
Exalted Sorcerer. But they are few and far between, and are often far
too wrapped up in own devices to mentor others. It is fortunate that
there are plenty of alternate mentors that may show up.

It is important to note that the source of Sorcery may train others in
levels past what they themselves have reached. A Mortal Sorcerer steeped
in the Emerald Circle may induct a Solar into the Adamant Circle.

#### Gods, Elementals, and Demons

As the original tutors of Sorcery, the various Spirits of the world may
be willing to do so again—though they are far more reluctant to do so
since the Age of Glory.

More often than not, being trained by a Spirit will leave a physical
mark upon the exalt—those taught by an Ifrit Lord will find their inner
fire breaking through their skin and smoke curling in their breath.

#### The Heptagram

Located in the northern reaches of the Realm, the Heptagram is perhaps
the only location in Creation with Sorcerers employed and organized into
a functioning teaching structure. Nearly all Dragonblooded Sorcerers
hail from this isolated fortress.

The separation of the Outer Provinces greatly impacted the Heptagram, as
nearly all knowledge of the Sapphire and Adamant Circles were seized in
protest as they fled the reach of the Realm.

#### The Salinian Working

As the Age of Glory crumbled and the Gods sealed themselves away from
mortals, the Sorcerers of old feared their art would be lost forever,
and so wove tutelage of Sorcery into the very fabric of Creation.

Now, very rarely, the knowledge of Sorcery will reveal itself in an
unrelenting fashion to individual chosen of forgotten and arcane
criteria. The knowledge and mentorship will take many forms, from a book
of infinite pages to the whispering of the winds through the trees.

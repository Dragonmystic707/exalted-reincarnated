Emerald

### <span class="smallcaps">All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight</span>

**Type:** Simple; Scene  
**Cost:** 2m

Making a quick incantation infused with essence and then gently pressing
a finger to their forehead, the Sorcerer is able to open their inner eye
to the flows of Essence surrounding them.

For the remainder of the scene, the character may make an (Intelligence
+ Occult) roll to observe and understand the traces of supernatural
spiritual energies around them, ranging to the tracks of spirits, to the
workings of levitating platforms, to even the subtle traces of other
Exalt’s powers.

### Coin of Distant Vision

**Type:** Permanent

When learning this Spell, the Sorcerer coalesces their flows of essence
around a shard of obsidian, entwining their senses with it, regardless
of its distance. Only one shard may be used at a time.

The Sorcerer may choose to peer their the obsidian shard as though it
were their own senses. If the shard is in a small container, such as a
pocket or pouch, they may sense beyond with a (-2) disadvantage.

### Corrupted Words

**Type:** Simple; Year  
**Cost: 3**m  
The Sorcerer coalesces a mass of all taboo words and topics into a small
egg-shaped mass in their hands, and whispers into it a new topic that
shall be bound with its unspoken peers. This could be something as
specific as “Secret Letters you will write to me” or as general as “The
Existence of the Sidereal Exalted.”  
On a successful (Intelligence + Sorcery) roll vs. Resolve a target, and
while close enough to physically do so, the Sorcerer may force this ball
of unspoken words down the throat of the target, binding their words on
the now taboo topic.

The now bound words will become impossible for the target to communicate
to another being—be it through words, written letters, or any other such
method. Attempting to do so will cause a vision of a mass of writhing,
repulsive maggots (or whatever else the target finds repulsive) crawling
from their mouth.

The Sorcerer may affect no more than (Essence) targets with this spell
at a time, and may choose to free their charges at will.

###  Summon Demon

**Type:** Ritual; Task  
**Cost:** 3m

Spending at least 15 minutes, out of sight of the Sun, the Sorcerer
draws an elaborate summoning circle detailing out the Ancient Contract
that will bring forth and bind an appropriate First Circle Demon (or
group of demons) to perform a task on behalf of the Sorcerer. A specific
demon may be named in the summoning, if desired.

Should the task be simple, such as delivering a message to a far off
place, it is done without question. However, if the task is more
complicated or requires the creature to stay in servitude for an
extended time, they will bargain for extra payment, which can be as
simple as motes expended, a taste of blood, or even certain
accommodations while performing the task. If a bargain is not struck,
they are simply banished back to where they came from.

The Demon (or group of demons) counts as an Ally (3) when in the service
of the Exalt, and the Exalt cannot have more than one active servant
attending them at any one time.

This Spell may also be used to summon Elementals, spirits, or even minor
Gods while in the presence of the Sun, though they are free to dismiss
the call for their summon and so are far more unreliable.

This Spell may be repurchased at the Sapphire and Adamant level to
summon Second and Third Circle Demons, which act as Ally (4) and (5),
respectively. They always demand a bargain when summoned, and the
summoning may only be performed as the Sun sets on the horizon.

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>It’s not a Faustian Deal</p>
<p>The Demons of Creation are bound to mortal servitude due to the surrender oaths after the War in Heaven. A Summon is simply a continuation of their punishment. If they have any ill will, it is with the Gods and their binding oaths, not the mortals who summoned them.</p>
<p>The terms of their servitude will bind the service of the Demon to the <em>spirit</em> of the contract, as well as the letter. A bound demon cannot and will not turn on their Summoner.</p>
<p>When a demon bargains, they are simply trying to get a <em>better</em> deal—personal comforts, or trophies of status.</p>
<p>The greatest threat that exists with summoning is the <em>alien</em> mindset of demons, their inhuman requests. A pack of Blood Apes tasked with protecting a young heir will do so—and will do so with wild abandon, crushing even the mildest of threats with no regard to collateral damage and then offering the dripping blood of the corpse to their young charge.</p>
<p><strong>There is one important caveat:</strong> the spell must be performed correctly. An Exalt incorrectly constructing a binding circle is unheard of, but woe be unto those Mortal sorcerers who are prone to sloppy handiwork, or those who foolishly attempt to summon a Demon of greater magnitude without training.</p></td>

### Theft of Memory

Cost: 5sm; Mins: Sorcery 2  
Duration: Indefinite

Focusing on a specific, known memory, the Sorcerer makes a (Wits +
Sorcery) roll vs the Target’s Guile.

If successful, they place a pure-cut emerald (Resources 2) on the
forehead of their target, and siphon the memory away into the gem. The
target may no longer relive the memory. Anyone with the gem may spend
1m, clasp it to their forehead and relive it.

The Sorcerer, casting this spell again, may pull the memory out of the
emerald, where it will return back to its original owner.

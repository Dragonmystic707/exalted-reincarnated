Martial Arts
============

Duality of Position Style
-------------------------

**Light Armor or Unarmored, Unarmed or Light**  
**Abilities:** Stealth, Paradox

The Martial Artist knows that the reality of position is malleable, and
more than one possibility exists.

When they enter this Form, the Stylist summons an alternate version of
themselves up to one range band away from their position. This visage of
themselves is called their “Shadow Copy,” which is a hazy visage of
their form cloaked in the fractured light of the alternate reality. It
gains +2 automatic successes on all stealth rolls during combat

Whenever the Stylist takes a Move action, the shadow copy **may** also
take a Move action of the same type, but in a different direction.

As well, Instead of taking a move action, the Stylist may choose to swap
places with their shadow copy.

Lesser Techniques
-----------------

### Collapsed Waveform

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Supplemental; Scene  
**Mins:** Stealth 1, Paradox 1

When the Stylist and their Shadow copy make a move action, they need not
cross the intervening space. Rather they entwine the possible where they
are already at their target location, and confuse reality into resolving
them into the desired location—which still must be *possible* for them
to reach in one action.

They make no footfalls to hear, for there are none to be made. They
disturb no traps, and portals such as doors remain unopened.

### Unresolved Duality

**Cost:** 1m  
**Type:** Supplemental  
**Mins:** Stealth 3, Paradox 2

The Stylist halfway transitions with their shadow copy. While making a
Flurry attack, they may attack any and all targets within reach of both
their original position and their shadow copy.

### Uncertain Direction Attack

**Cost:** 4m, 2i  
**Type:** Supplemental (Decisive)  
**Mins:** Stealth 4, Paradox 3

While making an attack in the same turn after swapping positions with
their shadow self, the Stylist strikes at their befuddled and confused
target, granting +(Essence) dice to their attack. As well, the attack
will target Soak.

##########  Greater Techniques

### Vanishing Act

**Cost:** 5m  
**Type:** Reflexive  
**Mins:** Stealth 4, Paradox 4

Upon being hit, the Stylist may reflexively swap places with their
shadow copy, dividing the total damage of the attack in half.

The Stylist will take the position of their shadow copy, and the copy
dissolves upon being struck, reforming on a spot next to the Stylist on
their next action.

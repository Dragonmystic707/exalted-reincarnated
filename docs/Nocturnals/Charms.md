Charms
======

Lesser Charms
-------------

### Familiar Face Confusion

**Cost:** 5m (committed)  
**Type:** Primary  
**Mins:** Deception 1, Luck 1

By chance, the Nocturnal is confused for another in a way that is
beneficial to the Nocturnal. This may either be by being mistaken for a
rank of an organization, or a specific person.

This may grant one temporary dot in a Merit such as Ally, Resources, or
Influence, or it may be as simple as being granted entry into a closed
party.

This charade lasts as long as the Nocturnal as Motes committed, until
the scene ends, or if the actual person/member of an organization the
Nocturnal is confused for shows up.

### Mind of the Mad Genius

**Cost:** 5m  
**Type:** Primary (Scene)  
**Mins:** Luck 3

A plan so daring, so implausible, so inefficient, and verging on madness
comes to Nocturnal.

The Player describes a plan so implausible, so dangerous, so inefficient
that it seems madness to even embark upon it.

And yet, should the proposed plan be carried through, the strategy will
work.

### Sometimes Apples Fly

**Cost:** 4m  
**Type:** Reflexive (Scene)  
**Mins:** Athletics 3, Paradox 3

The Nocturnal cuts their bonds with the reality that exists, and instead
tethers their bonds to the pull of the Night Sky.

While motes are committed, gravity for the Nocturnal is inverted and
allows them to fall upwards. Fall damage still applies.

### Dual Face Observation

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Primary  
**Mins:** Paradox 2, Awareness 2

You may observe a person, or specific point from two places (that you
could normally access) at the same time.

You may use this to place a “sentinel self” to watch guard while your
“true self” is performing normal tasks.

### Improbable Response

**Cost:** 3m  
**Type:** Reflexive  
**Mins:** Athletics 2, Paradox 1

A thousand possibilities flash before the Nocturnal’s form, allowing
them to predict an attack and move out of the way.

Reduce damage from an incoming attack by (Essence).

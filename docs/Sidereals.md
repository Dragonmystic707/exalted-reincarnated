Introduction
============

Character Creation
------------------

The Sideral gains access to separate aspects of reality, represented by
the Supernatural Abilities: **Journey, Serenity, Battles, Secrets,** and
**Endings.**

The Sidereal then gains an additional **Favored Ability** in the
Supernatural Ability associated with their Caste Name.

**Arcane Fate** Those who gaze upon the Sidereal with Resolve less than
or equal to the Sidereal's (Essence) do not recognize that a person is
in front of their eyes.

**Resplendent Destinies**. The Sidereal may take up to (Essence)
Personas, which the Loom of Fate back up as having relevant backing,
allies, and backgrounds to be in a location.

**Astrology**. Using their Supernatural Abilities, Sidereals can weave
Projects into the actual loom, causing changes to happen and befall a
city or civilization according to their domain.

**Formal Training**. If the Sidereal has been trained in heaven, they
gather the following:

-   Language: Old Realm

Supernatural Abilities
----------------------

### 

### Journey

\[\[Focuses on the concepts of **Space and Time**. Position,
placement\]\]

### Serenity

\[\[Focuses on **Emotion**, relations\-\--between people, and
civilizations\]\].

### Battles

\[\[Focuses on Conflict. Internal, External. \-\--this will need to be
defined better\]\]

### Serenity

\[\[Focuses on Knowledge, **memory**, and what reality is. \]\]

### Endings

\[\[Focuses on the changing of times, the turning of the guard. \-- this
needs better definitions \]\]

Castes
------

### Serenity

By spending a Strife Point, for the remainder of the scene Fate will
conspire to bring joy, happiness, revelry, and unification of a group of
people up to the size of a Village. All efforts to directly support this
endeavor receive (Essence) extra dice, while any direct efforts to
oppose this course of action take an (Essence)/2 (rounded up) penalty.

Strife Expression
-----------------

### Sidereal Fate

A Sidereal can manipulate Fate, making reality itself a tool for their
aid.

The Sidereal selects one of their Favored ability, and then can **change
the Target Number rolled** when that ability is used. They may either
reduce the target Number up to (Essence), or increase it by up to
(Essence)/2 for **all characters in the Scene.**

For example, an Essence 3 Sidereal targeting Archery could reduce all
Archery Rolls to Target Number 4, or increase it to a Target Number of
9.

1's are always failures, and 10s are always double successes.

Who Becomes a Sidereal?
-----------------------

\[\[A Sidereal is there because they were Fated to be a Sidereal\]\]

Great Curse
-----------

Sidereals are plagued by the certainty of **Fate**. They become tangled
in the webs of reality. They may rebel against what Fate says, believing
that there is no way to actually mess up any plans. They may become cold
and detached to prevent the whims of reality from hurt

Martial Arts
============

Heartstring Weaver Style
------------------------

Written by **Codex Empyrean**

**Light Armor, Bow (Light or Medium)**\
**Abilities:** Archery, Serenity

While in this style the practitioner is able to forge a simple ward for
themselves or an ally by solidifying the ambient love and compassion
around them.

The Practitioner bolster\'s their allies, choosing (**Essence**) wards
as combat breaks out. The ward applies a temporary bonus to maximum
**Endurance** to the target equal to the practitioner's **Essence x2**.
All damage will affect the ward first.

When the ward fades, either by loss of damage or if the Practitioner
decides to terminate it, the Practitioner may spend 2i as a Reflexive
action to whisk the target of the ward towards themselves, so long as
the ward is within Medium Range.

Lesser Techniques
-----------------

### The Heart Skips a Beat

**Cost:** 3m, 1i\
**Type:** Primary\
**Mins:** Archery 2, Serenity 1

The Archer of Joy rolls the entirety of an emotion into their shot,
imparting it into the target. Take a Distract Action with their (**Dex +
Serenity**) vs. the target\'s **Resolve**, with +(**Essence**) extra
successes.

### Drunk on Love

**Cost:** 5m, 1i (+3m)\
**Type:** Supplemental\
**Mins:** Archery3, Serenity 2

The Practitioner channels the ambrosia of distilled love into a single
arrow intoxicating the target. The archer makes a social attack with
their (**Archery + Serenity**) versus the target's Resolve. If the
target takes at least 5 points of damage, and the Archer pays an
additional (3m), the target will randomly attack any target on their
next action.

### Heart-A-Flutter

**Cost:** 5m\
**Type:** Reflexive; Scene\
**Mins:** Sorcery 4, Serenity 3:

The Practitioner becomes buoyed and carried by the very emotions of
serenity, allowing them to jump 20 meters into the air, as well as
drifting down slowly, unable to take Falling Damage.

When taking a Move action, the practitioner may do so vertically, even
into thin air. However, if they end their action without firm footing,
their next Round\'s Secondary Action will be consumed by them slowly
drifting to the ground.

Greater Techniques
------------------

### Wellspring of Compassion

**Cost:** 10m, 2i\
**Type:** Simple\
**Mins:** Archery 4, Serenity3

An Archer of Compassion can reweave their arrows to heal rather than
damage. Upon impact the arrow bursts into a shower of pink sparks. The
target's wounds begin to seal and a wellspring of energy fills them.\
\
The target regains **Endurance** equal to the archer's (**Serenity +
Essence**).

### Duality of Love

**Cost:** 7m, 2i\
**Type:** Simple; Instant/One Scene\
**Mins:** Archery 5, Serenity 4

The Practitioner weaves into their arrow either the pain and sorrow of
love or its warmth and hope.

**Sorrow**\
When imbuing the arrow with sorrow they deliver a devastating blow to
the target's psyche. The user makes an attack, using (**Dexterity +
Serenity**) as their roll, (**Essence**) as their Base Damage, and the
Target\'s (Resolve) in place of DV. In addition to dealing Damage, the
target suffers paralyzing grief for (**Essence**) rounds, only able to
take either a Primary or Secondary Action during their turn.

**Love\
**You create a bonding tie between the target and a concept, person, or
ideal of your choice on an (**Dexterity + Serenity)** hit over their
Resolve. Any Lesser Foes becomes an ally of that binding, whereas
Greater Foes gain an intimacy towards it, and must roll their (**Will**
+ **Integrity**) vs (Practitioner's **Serenity**) to directly harm it
for the remainder of the scene. If they succeed once on their roll, the
Intimacy is dispelled.

Charcoal March of Spiders
-------------------------

**No Armor, Unarmed**

**Abilities:** Sorcery, Secrets

While in this style, any movement action the practitioner takes is
crawling across the Loom itself, rather than the physical space. This
allows crawling through physical barriers, and avoiding environmental
effects.

The Practitioner is considered to be **Dematerialized** during these
brief moments, and cannot perceive the outside world.

The Practitioner reduces any grapple attempts made against them by -2
successes.

The Practitioner may use (Dexterity + Secrets) for their unarmed Attacks
Rolls.

Lesser Techniques
-----------------

### Unnatural Steps

**Cost:** 5m\
**Type:** Secondary\
**Mins:** Sorcery 2, Secrets 1

The Practitioner clings to the strands of Fate, not the ground beneath
her feet. As a Secondary Action, the practitioner may redirect to where
she falls towards\--be it towards a certain wall, a beam, a ceiling.
This target must be part of the scene and cannot be a person.

The Practitioner must use this technique again to change or cancel this
effect.

### Maw of Dripping Venom

**Cost:** 5m\
**Type:** Supplemental\
**Mins:** Sorcery 3, Secrets 2

On an attack that deals at least 1 point of damage, the target
immediately loses either 5 Peripheral Motes or 2 Impulse (Practitioner's
choice) for (Essence) Rounds.

Greater Techniques
------------------

### Rain of Unseen Threads

**Cost:** 10m\
**Type:** Simple; Scene\
**Mins:** Sorcery 4, Secrets 3

The Practitioner shoots out up to (Essence) threads to unattuned,
unattended objects, or otherwise unclaimed scenery within Medium Range,
and tears at their reality, altering some metaphysical aspect of them.
Pillars become soft as clay, toppling over in an instant; water as light
as air and rising to the sky.

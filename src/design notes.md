#### Character Sheet
* Text wrapping might be helpful, perhaps in Intimacies.
* More intimacy spaces for later advancement?
* Make separate check box for Supernal attribute?
* Is there a place for Anima powers? I didn’t see one.
* How to spend Resources is confusing. Move the table up—they will assume 1 Res = 1 dot otherwise.
* From the character creation rules, it sounds like buying a martial art is mandatory. Could it be phrased more clearly?

**Make Spots for:**
* Strife
* Strife Expression
* Anima Power
* Martial Arts Form
* Supernal (Solar)
* Put XP table costs in character sheet
* Defining Intimacy mark.


General Notes
-------------

+(Essence) doesn’t feel good at low levels. I need to rethink charms with this effect.

#### Abilities
* Make clear that Solar “associated abilities” are not additional Favored abilities

#### Merits
* I like the addition of a common tongue


Done

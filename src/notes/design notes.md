### Overall Notes

# Look at Skulldiggers rpg by Gnome
- how it handles three different types of groups.

## Should I rethink Attribute + ability?
On the surface, Attribute + ability seems fun--an endless way to combine things together. But really, there are only a few combinations that people use, and a few that just get completely ignored.

I'm also wondering about the relationship between Abilities and Derived stats. Something feels off.

## Limit
Should I lower the threshold to 5? Or are my players just too hesitant and resistant to gain limit?

## Motes
Simplify motes. Reduce to a common denominator, and make each mote count.

## Charms
Global charms should be based off of Abilities, but I think that Exalt-specific charms should just be broken down by caste, and not have ability requirements at all. Sorta like Ex v. Wod.

## Lore
I want to change lore to be a merit. Lore: local history. Lore: Celestial Politics. Etc. etc.  You expend a charge of your merit to Introduce a fact about it, or Int + Lore (merit rank) to know something if necessary.

## Ability List
* Artiface (specified craft)
* Archery
* Athletics (contains dodge)
* Awareness
* Brawl
* Integrity
* Leadership (Presence + war)
* Melee
* Medicine (contains survival--may need new name)
* Navigation (contains ride, sail, and parts of survival)
* Performance
* Physique
* Politics (renamed beuracracy)
* Socialize
* Stealth
* Subterfuge (split off of socialize + manipulation)
* Thrown
* Sorcery
* Necromancy

Notes about abilities with derived values:
* Combat values are fine, you can make a combat value out of anything.
* Athletics seems to be okay. Movement and a defense combined together.
* Subterfuge -- the one I'm most worried about. It's solely what Guile is based off of.

## Possible specializations/Trained abilities?
I might consider there to be 3 categories of abilities: Natural, trained, and Supernatural.

Natural would be anything that has a defensive derived value, or is straightforward--integrity, athletics, subterfuge(?) Awareness...

The argument for is that it works well for lore, performance, and Craft. Whenever you choose one of these abilities, you choose one of its specializations, and must work within that sub-set. Working out of the subset is a -2 dice penalty (minimum 0).  Could work well for the combat abilities--close combat (swords, fists, axes...) Ranged (archery, knives, magic...)  Can purchase new specializations.

The argument against is that the dice really don't matter, and that it's the power choice that really determines what you "specialize" in.

### Specialties
Specialties need to be redone.  Or removed. Or something.

Is what charms, martial arts, etc. your specialty?


### Social
I need to make Social a bit more involved. I'm thinking of bringing back the "methods" of social interaction --bribing, intimidation, etc. But I really don't like the implimentation of 3e, didn't feel right.

### Projects
I had the argument of making Project Obstructions (drawbacks?) random. But I think I'm wrong on this. I should maybe switch to a more player-controlled method.  An easy way to do this would be to have a target number which the player rolls for, then makes the difference up with obstructions that are worth X number of points.

Also, I really need to make it clearer what types of projects can be done with what abilities--even if it is a soft restriction/ Guidance

## Resources
Resource cost and gain seem a bit off. Too cheap at the low end, too expensive at the top end.  I do like the Keystone aspect, though.

May lower the range and effect of Free-form projects.

Start with more merits.

### Encounters
This should become "guidance on how to run a scene." make a note that a lot of things, specifically in the social scene (command task) requires an Encounter scene to work.

### Combat

## Initiative
Popcorn initiative? May be worth looking into.

First character goes. Whoever initiated the combat, or if people can't decide, 1d10+Initiative rolloff. Then each person picks which character goes next--friend or foe--until the last character of the round goes, whom picks the character that starts the next round (which can include themselves.)

Interrupts -- after someone names their successor, you force yourself into the spot, using up your turn for the round. After your turn, it goes to the named successor. Could be used for something like defensive protection.

Balance interrupts/multiple actions --- if you've got a Big Bad, there should be a way for them to take multiple actions per turn--especially against a larger group of players.  Can't have them take more than two actions in a row, though.


## Unarmed, Light, Medium, Heavy

The following is default, subject to martial arts and charms.
Unarmed - May use dex or strength. Grants no bonuses. May target evasion or soak.
Light Weapons - Must use Dexterity. Grants bonus accuracy. May target Evasion.
Medium Weapons - May use dex or strength. Grants small bonus to accuracy and damage. May target evasion or soak.
Heavy Weapons - Must use Strength. Grants damage bonus. May target Soak.

Unarmored - No bonuses
Light - bonus to evasion, penalty to soak.
Medium - bonus to soak, penalty to evasion.
Heavy - extra bonus to soak, heavy penalty to evasion.


DV, soak, evasion, and Parry.
DV is the greater of soak and evasion. To target one or the other, you have to expend either motes or impulse.

Some attacks (such as explosions) target one or the other naturally, and the two act as checks.

Soak can naturally defend others, unlike evasion.

Parry is a conditional, active defense that may be put in place of Evasion. Often has restrictions on when it can be used, how, or costs a resource to use. Requires a charm or technique. Can be used to defend others, as well as *deflect* attacks. Parry is based on your attack skill.


#### Character Sheet
* Text wrapping might be helpful, perhaps in Intimacies.
* More intimacy spaces for later advancement?
* Make separate check box for Supernal attribute?
* Is there a place for Anima powers? I didn’t see one.
* How to spend Resources is confusing. Move the table up—they will assume 1 Res = 1 dot otherwise.
* From the character creation rules, it sounds like buying a martial art is mandatory. Could it be phrased more clearly?

**Make Spots for:**
* Strife
* Strife Expression
* Anima Power
* Martial Arts Form
* Supernal (Solar)
* Put XP table costs in character sheet
* Defining Intimacy mark.


General Notes
-------------

+(Essence) doesn’t feel good at low levels. I need to rethink charms with this effect.

#### Abilities
* Make clear that Solar “associated abilities” are not additional Favored abilities

#### Merits
* I like the addition of a common tongue


Done
----

* Fixed folder structure of zip file.
* Made Attribute selection clearer

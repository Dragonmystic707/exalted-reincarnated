Notes on how to use this repository:

NEED INSTALLED:
Libreoffice
python

(Potentially Java? Libreoffice was a bit weird about not having it.)

Install Python. Then 
pip install -r requirements.txt

NOTES:
There's some silly things I've had to do because the software doesn't work correctly.
Periodically check on updates to see if these things are fixed (they probably won't be)

-   pandoc does not export out .odt (libreoffice) files correctly
-       Solution: Convert the .odt to .docx, then to markdown.

-   Libreoffice command line "convert-to pdf" does not work on master documents
-       Solution: Wrote a macro that converts to pdf, then launch the document with that macro

AUTO UPDATE LINKS
In Libreoffice:
-   Tools->Options
-   LibreOffice Writer->General
Set "Update Links When Loading" to "Always

MACRO SECURITY
In Libreoffice, we need to let macros be run from this directory

-   Options->LibreOffice->Security->Macro Security
-   Trusted->Sources->Trusted File Locations

Add the repo directory as a trusted file location.

MACRO FOR EXPORT
Convert to pdf commands don't really work on the Master Document, so I recorded/wrote a macro
that does it for us.

This would be so much easier if convert to pdf properly worked.

In LibreOffice:
-   Tools->Macros->Organize Macros->Basic
-   Organizer
Add a new Module named "Exalted" in "Standard"
Then click on that Module and select "Edit"

-   File->Import Basic
Select and import "Exalted_macros.bas"


TESTING LOCALLY

-   Install Ruby
Go to the docs folder
-   gem install github-pages   (gem update github-pages)

When ready to test
-   jekyll build
-   jekyll serve
